<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Dams along the Columbia river have been an indisputably important factor in the long history
of the northwest. The dams that were constructed along the rivers in the area, provided huge
amounts of electricity and water to vast new areas in the northwest. Then on top of that with the
massive surplus of water that was made available, the agriculture industry grew rapidly, and
expanded to cover more territory in of the inland areas of the state. The electricity that was made
extremely cheap allowed more intensive industries like manufacturing to become extremely viable
and profitable in the northwest. Theses industries kick-started the economy of the northwest and
drew thousands of employees to the area. However, these dams were also very negative for many
people. They destroyed the natural flow of the river. They flooded many traditional lands
that were used by the native Americans, and the dams greatly disrupted the migration
of native fish populations. There are may voices that speak out in favor of the dams
such as large companies, or major businesses, nominally the people who are supporting
the dams have an economic advantage. Then there are the many other groups who
are opposed to the dams along the Columbia river, such as the native Americans, the
environmentalists, many fishermen. These people have much less economic interest in
the dams, and some actually have an economic interest in the lack of the dams. Each
side of the argument has their own voices for and against the damming of the river.
The damming along the Columbia river has been a critical par of the history of the
northwest, and without it, the region would not be anything that it is today, however, as
newer technology has allowed the benefits of the dams without the great amounts of
environmental harm, there has been a more successful push for the removal of some of the dams
along the Columbia. The dams on the Columbia were more beneficial when they were
constructed, but as time has passed their cons have begun to out weigh the pros of the
dams.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   The first explorers to come to the northwest were on the search for a major transportation
river, that could connect to the eastern half of the country. This great river highway would allow
for Americans to easily cross the country by boat, and would open up a wealth of new
opportunities. The Columbia River was initially hoped to be a major transportation network, but
as further exploration revealed, the river was extremely difficult to navigate, and the section of the
river that were navigable was extremely one sided. A ship could take weeks traveling a short
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
distance up river, a distance which could be covered in only a few days when traveling down river.
This discrepancy between the efficiency of the travel speeds meant that the Columbia
river and its major tributaries were not a viable network for transportation of goods.
And in a world where every major city is constructed on the ocean or a major river for
transportation, this meant that the Columbia river would not be well suited for many large
cities further up river than Portland which was considered the furthest upriver that
major ocean ships could travel. However, with the construction of the dams, this dream
of the Columbia being a major transportation network has come closer to a reality
than it ever has been before. It is now possible to ship thousands of tons of goods up
and down the Columbia river, and it is all only because of the dams along the river
to create the reservoirs that river boats can successfully navigate. Although it is not
perfect, and has caused numerous other issues, the Columbia river has been a major
shipping route for the northwest, shipping thousands of tons of goods a year&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. With the
vast amounts of goods that are exported by means of the Columbia river, all of which
would not be possible at the present scale if not for the dams along the river. However,
with newer technology such as aircraft, or more efficient trains, these goods can be
shipped faster and for similar to lesser costs then they historically could by means of the
river.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   The dams along the Columbia and Snake river are vital to the agriculture industry of the
northwest. The dams provide huge amounts of water for the inland farms that were constructed in
the desert of the northwest. However, this extremely fertile soil can be accessed, because of the
dams. Dams such as the Grand Coulee dam were constructed to easily provide irrigation water to
thousands of farmers in the area. The water that these dams can provide for inland farmers has
been a key factor in the agricultural growth of the northwest. This water has in fact allowed the
Columbia and Snake river area the largest exporter of wheat in the United States, with an export
amount of currently 11 million tons of grain exported from the Columbia river&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>.
Thousands of farmers rely on the water provided by the dams along the Columbia river,
there are approximately 5,100,000 acres of land that are irrigated by the Columbia river
water&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. And this water is a vital part of the industry. Other than hydroelectric power,
agriculture is the next largest consumer of Columbia river water. The huge industry of
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
agriculture needs the dams to exist, as most of the extremely fertile land in the northwest is
located in deserts, and does not naturally receive enough water for proper irrigation, and
agriculture. One clear aspect of a voice that clearly shows its support of the dams is
from the Washington Grain Commission (WGC). The WGC has a list of &#8220;Facts&#8221; on
their website, which although all of their sources are trustworthy, the facts that were
selected all clearly demonstrate their bias towards the dams, and their clear support of the
dams&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. The reliance of the Columbia river dams for irrigation water, and the fact that
without the dams, millions of acres of farmland would not exist, is a clear sign that
the agricultural industries heavily relies on the dams, and needs them in order to be
profitable.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   The large farmers were greatly benefited by the Columbia basin project, because the dams
provided plenty of water and electricity for any farm land. Even though the initial plans were for
much smaller farm lands, and so the units of land were started in a much smaller range of 10 to
160 acres depending on the quality of the land&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. However, these small sized farm units grew
outdated, as new technology made it easy for a few farmers to maintain a large amount of
land.This growth of technology while the rules of the lands remained stagnant was a major cause
for the shift to larger farms. Because a few farmers could easily manage land in access of the
previous maximum 160 acres, congress passes a new law that allowed farm operators to hold
multiple units each up to 160 acres, and along with that, there was the free ability to lease farm
units to others&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. So it was common for a few farmer to be managing much more
land that the plan initially intended. The average farm size grew from 84 acres to 107
acres.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   The small farmers in the northwest were greatly affected by the construction of the dams. As
the dams allowed their water and electricity to be extremely cheap. This meant that all the farms
in the region could easily water all of their land and keep their crops sustainable for many years.
Thousands of acres of land was opened up for the small farmers to use, and for thousands of
immigrants to begin a new life with. Regions around the rivers that had a dam were suddenly a
destination for travelers because of the vast availability of the land. Many of the counties even
created hundreds of blocks of land that were allotted to farmers who wanted them. Most of these
farm lots consisted of 140 acres, so every farm was relatively small, and designed to
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
be managed by a single family. All of these steps were taken in order to benefit the
small farmer as much as possible. However, their results were the opposite of what the
planners initially wanted. In the following years most of these small farms were taken over
by large super farms. These super farms control hundreds of acres, much beyond the
initially allotted 140 acres. These super farms were able to thrive in the situations that
dams had created. Because electricity and water was mad extremely cheap, the super
farms could easily afford to pay for the irrigation of their enter lands. Then with the
advancement in technology, these super farms could maintain more land with fewer workers,
making it much more viable to control large tracts of land. Along with all of those
factors, the farming equipment that was necessary for irrigation of the land, was very
expensive, so the small farmers who needed it could not afford it, but the super farms,
could easily afford the equipment, and would earn enough money to pay it off quickly.
Although the dams were constructed with the intention of supporting the small farmer,
they incidentally created an environment that was perfect for large scale industrialized
farms.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Small family run farms, is most peoples hope of the perfect farm lands. However, this is rarely
the reality, instead most farm land is large scale corporate owned farm land, that is run by
machines, and very few workers. With the Columbia Basin Project many organizers were
hopeful that they could change this and achieve and area of family run farmlands. The
Columbia Basin Project was an initiative that aligned with the construction of the dams
along the Columbia river, to irrigate much of the extremely dry Columbia basin. The
project very ambitiously planed to irrigate 1,100,000 acres of land with the water that
would be backed up due to the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. The plan was to
distribute the land into blocks of 140 acres, and divide this land up among thousands of
small farm families who could then live there, and being a new farm&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. The initial
intentions were valid for the planers, to try to draw small farmers to the area with
cheap and subsidized land, then provided government-subsidized irrigation for the land
by means of the Grand Coulee Dam. However, this did not proceed as it was initially
intended. The first draft of the plan was to only provide small farms for family farmers,
however as time passed, and the price for the dam grew, the organizers came to realize
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
that larger farms would be much more profitable and pay for the cost of the dam much
sooner, than small farms. Thus the size of the farm plots grew, and grew until it was
no longer for small family farmers, but for large corporate organizations&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. Another
issue that occurred, was that the federal government and the local one, both wanted to
assist small farmers, but they both wanted to have control of the project, as a result
of this neither organization succeeded, and the family farms began to fail in favor to
the larger corporate farms. One of the major causes for the failure of these smaller
farms, was technology. As technology rapidly developed, the large farms could easily
afford the new tools, that made them even more cost efficient, while a small family
farmer could not even dream of catching up with the rapidly developing technology of
agriculture tools&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. The Columbia basin project came nowhere close to what it was
initially to be, and as more time passes, antiquated decisions still hold, for example the
government still supplies many farmers in the area with water at significantly subsidized
prices.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   Industry in the northwest was vital for the development of the population centers in the region.
Large industries create a high demand for workers, this demand for workers makes the
northwest a better destination for potential migrants, who would have a job in the region.
This means that the large number of industries would have been a large draw for the
thousands of Americans who were moving to the west. One of the major industries that was
created in the northwest was the aluminum smelting. The aluminum mills required a huge
amount of electricity to run, and that was exactly what the dams on the Columbia
river would provide. Because the dams created such a surplus of electricity, and the
rivers could be used to export the aluminum, the locations around the dams became the
perfect location for these aluminum mills. The northwest became such a large area for
aluminum production that it was the largest aluminum exporter in the country. These
huge industries caused a huge draw for more people. Because that was a great amount
of possible profit in the aluminum industry, but they needed many more employees,
the number of people coming to the northwest grew greatly. These major industries
were a major kick start to the economy of the northwest,as well as a jump start in
the population of the region. All of this resulted from the industries that sprouted up
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
around the Columbia river, and the industries were drawn to the Columbia because of
the cheap electricity that the river dams offered. Because of this the dams helped kick
start the economy and the population of the region. Along with the draw of industries,
the dams themselves provided thousands of jobs. During the peak of construction of
the Grand Coulee dam, there was approximately 8,800 workers, only some of those
were directly construction workers, the others were for telephone, and water and other
resources that were necessary for the small city of people that came to work on the
dam&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   The largest of the dams along the Columbia river was the Grand Coulee dam, which began
construction in 1935 and was completed in 1941&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. The completion of the dam had a large effect
on the industries in the region, in particular the aluminum industry. When the dams along the
river were completed, the federal government encouraged aluminum companies to construct
aluminum smelters around the dam, in order to have a use for the vast amounts of energy
that was produced&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. Many aluminum smelters were drawn to the Northwest, by the
invitation from the federal government and the whole sale price of electricity. They were
also drawn to the accessibility to aluminum consumers, such as aircraft producers&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>.
However, this draw of industry was not a permanent one, as time has passed, the price of
electricity has become less important in the process of aluminum production, and has been
swapped for a favor of being located closer to the source of the aluminum ore, and reduce
transpiration costs. Because the northwest does not produce any of its own aluminum ore, the
aluminum industry has begun to move to location where the ore is more readily available,
such as china&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. However, these aluminum smelters were a critical part in drawing in
industries to the northwest, and support the economy of the developing region, and these
industries were only drawn because of the cheap electricity that was provided by the
dams.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   When viewing the time of completion for the Grand Coulee Dam (1941), and the census data
for Oregon around that time, there is a clear jump in population the few years after the dam is
completed. The population jumped 114,000 people in one year, which previous years was only
showing a growth of about 20,000 people. This sudden growth is 5.7 times the average growth rate
of the time, and occurs the year following the construction of the dam&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. Although the
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
population of Oregon has grown much more than what it used to be, and the jump
present at that time appears less influential, the total population at the time was only
1,107,000, so this jump represented about %9<span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span>71 of the population at the time. This is
an undeniable growth of people, which occurred directly after the completion of the
largest dam along the Columbia river. Some of these people came because of the offered
land for small farmers, as the dam provided water to more than 2,000 farms&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. And
many of the people form the population boom would be resultant of the entrance of
the aluminum industries, which employed more that 2,000 employees in Oregon alone.
It can be reasoned that the Grand Coulee dam was a major cause for the influx of
people.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately these industries were placed around the river dams because they required
immense amounts of electrify, which then made is less available for others. Another unfortunate
side effect of these industries, in particular the aluminum smelters, is that they produce an extreme
amount of pollution. Although these industries created many job positions, and greatly helped the
economy of the region, they were also extremely damaging to the natural environment. These
industries that were draw to the river dams, were damaging an environment that was
already hurt by the construction of the dams themselves. All of these industries were
very important in their own way for the legacy of the northwest and the Columbia
river, but they all were also very damaging to an already damaged environment. And as
there realizations have come to be more prevalent in today&#8217;s society, these industries
are moving else where, and leaving the northwest. This departure of the industries,
means that the power of the hydroelectric plants were not going to use, and so now these
dams cannot provide their maximum amount of energy, and are becoming much less
useful. A few of the dams along the rivers have been re-proposed to supply electricity
to data centers. Data centers are the new major industry, that needs huge amounts
of electricity to run, and the dams are one of the only sources for them. The benefit
that data centers have over other historically conventional industries, is that location
does not matter in any way. However, data centers are not needed on every dam along
the river, only one or two of the dams along the rivers will be used for data centers.
This means that there are many more river dams that will lose most of their use, as
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
public electricity can be sourced from else where, and the major electricity consumers
leave.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   The aluminum smelters were in themselves a large source of environmental damage. Because of
the process of extraction the aluminum metal creates a large amount of green house gasses, which
is then released into the atmosphere. When people are already disapproving of the dams on the
river for disrupting the natural environment, the fact that more pollutant producing industries
came to the region, angered many of the environmentalists. The aluminum industries that came to
the region produce hundreds of tons of green house gasses a year. Some of which are orders of
magnitude more damaging the common carbon dioxide&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. Just the fact that these
dams enticed the aluminum smelters to come to the northwest was a direct cause of the
destruction of the environment, more so that the dams were already causing to the
environmental damage. Although these industries that were drawn to the northwest
because of the dams had a significant footprint on the economy of the northwest, and were
able to bring thousands of workers to the region, the overall environmental impact was
disastrous&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. The aluminum smelting plants produced immense amounts of pollution, and
because they were being provided electricity at a whole sale rate, it was possible for
them to produce aluminum at a very rapid rate and for much less. And now as time
has passed, and the aluminum smelters are favoring more profitable locations for their
plants, the plants in the northwest are disappearing, and becoming obsolete, leaving their
permanent mark on the global environment, and moving to a new land where they can start
anew.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   When the planing begin for the dam construction along the Columbia river, the native
Americans were not taken into account in any way. Because of this several native American villages
were torn up in order for the dams to be constructed, and with out much more than a though for
the tribes that resided in those villages. At most they were provided with some temporary shelter,
and at least they were provided with nothing&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. Many families were evicted from their traditional
homelands and forced to move to new lands, without being compensated for anything. The most
that the government has done is designate several fishing sites along the river to make up for the
traditional locations that were flooded by the backwater of the dam reservoirs. The
construction of the dams displaced dozens of people, across several tribes, and the non-native
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Americans who were displaced by the dam construction were treated in a much different
manner. The non-native Americans were provided permanent homes by the government,
along with assistance in relocation&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. This is a clear distinction to the native tribes
that had lived on these lands for generations, who where forced to move without much
consideration and with little to no compensation for the loss of their historical tribal
home. The view of the planners tasked with the construction of the dams was all focused
on the economical gain that could be achieved, and they did not consider the natural
environments that they would be destroying, or the traditional lands of natives that
would be flooded. These dams were only created for the interest of the investors, and
with the price tag that they cam with it makes sense that the primary view of the dam
is how soon it can pay off the price. However, this allowed the environment and the
people how lived off of the river in its current sate to become neglected by the project
planers.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   The dams have had a very large and indisputable impact on the native fish populations along
the Columbia river, and its tributaries.The dams cause it to be extremely difficult for many
anadromous fish species to travel up and down from their native spawning grounds and to the
ocean. Despite the sheer magnitude of money that has been poured into creating ways for the
fish to navigate around the dams, the damage has already been done, and cannot be
undone. Even as the powerful companies that are profiting form the dams attempt to
make amends by constructing fish hatcheries along the rivers, this is no substitute for
the original strand of fish that developed in the rivers and tributaries. Although there
have been continues development to find new ways to help fish to swim past the dams.
However, any method that is used for moving fish around the dams can never be as good
as the natural river was, as that is what the fish evolved to do, and when this path
was disrupted, there is almost nothing that can substitute that. The two major fish
species that live in the Columbia river area are the salmon and steelhead. The first
issue is that the dams block passage of the fish between their spawning habitat and the
ocean. Many major dams have included fish ladders or other mechanisms to assist in
transporting fish around the dams, but there are many more dams that do not include some
form of fish passage, and because of this %55 of the once accessible spawning area has

dams, can also be equally dangerous to the salmon and steelhead. Because dams cause
the flow of water of slow, the temperature of the water can rise to dangerously high
levels, and can even become so hot that it is lethal to the fish&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. The variant flow of
water can be deadly for the fish as well. Because the dams further upriver can cause the
water level to rise and fall, the fish eggs can be shifted closer to the surface. Then when
the dam reduces the throughput, the water level falls, and these fish eggs have been
stranded in the open air, where they fish inside will die&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]</span>. The natural environment
that these fish evolved for has been completely destroyed by the dams. Even though
the dams have attempted to make amends, by constructing fish hatcheries, however
these have actually resulted in the diluted genetic lines, which is also harming the fish
populations.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   The dams along the Columbia River have been of great importance in the years around their
construction. The dams themselves were a huge provider of employment during construction, then
they drew a large number of industries which also provided large numbers of jobs. Both of these
were extremely influential on the economy of the northwest at the time, and helped draw
thousands of people to move to the northwest. These dams also assisted in the creation of much of
the agricultural area in the northwest, through irrigation and several programs to provide land
to new farmers. However, the dams were also a great cause of damage to the natural
environment, and to some of the people of the northwest. The native Americans were
ignored, and displaced by the construction of the dams, and a multitude of different
habitats were destroyed, and particularly the salmon and steelhead fish populations have
lost much of their traditional habitats, and routes. Although the dams were extremely
important when they were created, as they have provided vast amounts of utility, they have
begun to become obsolete with time. The major industries that needed the electricity are
moving away and farms have become extremely efficient at utilizing very little electricity.
And the region has grown enough that the economy can be sustained through other
means. Now the dams are mainly damming the fish populations. Because of this gradual
reduction in the utility of the dams, some of them can be removed. However, some
dams should always remain standing, as they still have great utility in flood prevention,
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
and water management, but the number of dams that currently stands is no longer
necessary.
