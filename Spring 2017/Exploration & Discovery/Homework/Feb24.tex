\begin{document}
This was an orginization that was made to protect the jobs of the average fisherman on the Columbia River. The job of the Columbia River Fisherman's Protective Union(CRFPU) was to make work better for the fishermen on the Columbia River and by seeing what they faught for, it is posible to see what the fishermen wanted. The union was first created the 16\textsuperscript{th} of August, 1875. The first goal of the union was to establish boundries for the gillnet fishermen, and to create a death benefit for the widows of fishermen who died working. The union sought to improve pay, safety, navigation, and preserve the salmon population in the river. This union showed that the fishermen of the time, were underpaid, and worked in very dangerous conditions, aswell as overfishing could quickly lead to their entier profession becoming obsolete.
