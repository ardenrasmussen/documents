\begin{abstract}
  Matrix multiplication is a key part of may different computer algorithms, and
  is widely used across the fields of computer science. Because of the important
  role that it plays, much work has been put into developing more efficient
  algorithms for matrix multiplication. A lot of progress has been made because
  of this research, there are now a number of different matrix multiplication
  algorithms, that are used for different purposes. This paper will compare the
  best, average, and worst case time and memory requirements for these
  different matrix multiplication algorithms, and provide some guidelines as to
  when the different methods are most useful.
