title: Proposal

The primary goal of this independent study is to expand the path tracing
implementation that I began work on last semester.

I will be expanding the abilities of the library that I developed last
semester, specifically I will be focusing on improving the artistic controll of
the path tracer, and the preformance of the algorithms.

I will meet with my supervisor weekly to discuss the progress that I have made,
and my preformance will be evaluated at the end of the semester, based upon the
code that I have develoed.

I will develop a library, and write a paper on the algorithms that I have
implemented into the software. The final test will be if the program is able to
render several scenes that the supervisor has defined.

We will meet weekly, and be able to email each other if need be.
