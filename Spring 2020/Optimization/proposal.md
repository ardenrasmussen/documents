title: Proposal
author: Arden Rasmussen

The primary goal of this independent study is to expand my understanding of
optimization theory, and its applications to computer science.

I will be reading through "Algebra, Topology, Differential Calculus, and
Optimization Theory For Computer Science and Machine Learning" by Jean Gallier
specifically the sections on optimization theory and its applications for
computer science.

I will meet with my supervisor weekly to discuss the progress that I have made,
and my performance will be evaluated at the end of the semester based upon my
understanding of Optimization theory, and the document that I produce at the
end of the semester.

I will write up a document on the topics that I understand, and their
application to computer science, and if applicable I will implement the theory
in a piece of software.

We will meet weekly, and be able to email each other if need be.
