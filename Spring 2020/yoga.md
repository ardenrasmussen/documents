Over the past semester I feel that doing daily yoga has helped me stay
centered, especially in light of current events, I though that the practice of
doing yoga every day was very helpful to give my mind a moment to rest in this
crazy time, and just allowed me some time to focus on my body, and kind of
forget the stresses of the rest of the world.

I have noticed an improvement in my flexibility, and now with the
self isolation, being stuck at home, having the knowledge of how to do a proper
yoga session, has meant that I have been able to continue to stay physically fit
though the yoga. I think that this has been really good for my mental health,
as it gives me some physically activity, and a meditative time of day, where I
can aim at releasing the stresses that have built up over the day.

I have really appreciated the decision to take yoga te past two semesters, I
think that they have been really helpful for my mental state during the
semester, and it has given me enough knowledge to continue practicing yoga
into the future, and how to do so safely, and to not push myself too far.

I really think that yoga is a fantastic tool to keep balance in my life,
because it both helps with mental balance of being a meditative, so it provides
me with grate mental balance, and it is physical activity and so during this
time of being stuck at home, having this physical activity to do daily, then
practicing yoga has been fantastic for my physical balance.
