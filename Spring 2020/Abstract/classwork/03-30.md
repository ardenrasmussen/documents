Suppose $f(x)\in\mathbb{z}[x]$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Thus
$f(x)=b(x)c(x)$, then by (29) we know we can multiply by the lcm of the
denominators of the coefficents to get a polynomial with integer coefficients,
and thus we have $kb(x)$ and $lc(x)$. Then $klf(x)=(kb(x))(lc(x))$...

$2x^3+6x^2-15x-12$ We consider $p=3$ as $3|12$, $3|15$, $3|6$, and $3\nmid 2$,
and $9\nmid 12$, thus by thm 2.28 $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

## a
since $p|f_0$ and $f_0=b_0c_0$, then $p|b_0c_0$ so $p|b_0$ or $p|c_0$.
## b
$p\nmid c_v$ as $p\nmid f_n$ with $f_n=b_uc_v$, so $p\nmid b_uc_v$, and thus
$p\nmid b_u$ and $p\nmid c_v$.
## c
$a_k=b_0c_k+b_1c_{k-1}+\ldots+b_kc_0$
## d
Since we have shown that $p\nmid c_v$ and $p\nmid b_0$, then $p|b_0c_k$ is a
contradiction.

Yes...
