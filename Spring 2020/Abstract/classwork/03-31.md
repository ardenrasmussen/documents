# Field Extensions

## Problem 1

By definition $E$ contains both $F$ and $S$. Let $G=\bigcap_\text{H field
containing F and S} H$, then $F(S)\subseteq G$ because $G$ contains both $F$
and $S$, so by definition $F(S)\subseteq G$. $G\subseteq F(S)$ because $F(S)$
is an element of the intersection, and so thus $G\subseteq F(S)$, thus we can
conclude that $G=F(S)$.

## Problem 2

($\Rightarrow$) Assume $F=F(a)$. By definition, $F(a)$ is the smallest field
containing $a$, so $a\in F(a)=F$.

($\Leftarrow$) First assume $a\in F$, then the smallest field containing both
$a$ and $F$ will be $F$, so $F(a)\subseteq F$, and $F\subseteq F(a)$ by
definition.

## Problem 3

$(x^2+1)=(x-i)(x+i)$, thus the roots are $\pm i$, and thus there are no real
solutions. Since $\mathbb{C}[x]$ is a uFD we conclude that $x^2+1$ is
irreducible in $\mathbb{R}[x]$. Thus $i\in\mathbb{C}$ can be adjoined to
$\mathbb{R}$ to create $\mathbb{R}(i)$, where $(x^2+1)$ is reducible.
