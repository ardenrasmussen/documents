# Automatic Group

This is the group of finitely generated groups, which have a finite-state
automata that represents the Cayley graph of the group. This seems
interesting to me as a cross of computer science and group theory. It seems
that the relation can be used both ways, in using group theory concepts in
the application of finite state automata, and in using finite state automata
to solve problems in group theory.

# Elliptic Curves in Cryptography

This appears to be using specially constructed groups can be considered for
use in cryptography. Specifically Elliptic Curves. It seems that group theory
can be used to construct secure key transfers, based off of the selection of
specific groups.

# Rubik's Cube

Many proofs involving the Rubik's cube are rooted in group theory, such as
the algorithms that were used to determine the minimum number of necessary
moves to solve any scramble of a rubik's cube is 20. In general the
operations of rotating an edge is treated as a group which acts on the cube.
Then by altering the cube so that it is in smaller and smaller subsets of the
possible states, eventually the cube enters the solved state.
