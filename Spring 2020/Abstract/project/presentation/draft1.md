# **The World problem for Automatic groups**

_Arden Rasmussen_

---

## Introduction

The word problem is the question of if two representations of some elements are equivalent.

Consider the group $D_4$, then the question is:

> Are $aababa^{-1}bbabbaab^{-1}a^{-1}b$ and $aba^{-1}a^{-1}baaab^{-1}a^{-1}b$ the same?
