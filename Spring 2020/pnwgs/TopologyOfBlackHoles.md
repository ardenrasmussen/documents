# Horizons of black holes

* Future event horizons
  * The boundary of the region from which timelike curves extend to infinity.
* Apparent horzions
  * The boundary of the "outer trapped" region.
  * Marginally outer trapped. Lorentzian version of a minimal surface.
* Killing horizion:
  * A null hypersurface to which a Killing vector filed is normal.
  * Two known types: bifurcate and degenerate.
  * Caution: Even Minkowski spacetime has Killing horizions.
