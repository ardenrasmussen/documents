# Ricci flow

This appears to be the deformation of a riemannian metric for a manifold in a
method analogous to the heat equation.

Two ways to think about Ricci flow:

* Inital value problem for a parabolic PDF system
* Dynamical system

# We know a lot about Ricci flow for:

* 2 and 3 dimensional riemannian manifolds
* Riemannian metrics on compact manifolds with large isomotries.

# Convergence stability for ricci flow

* Does the metric converge to a stable metric at $\infty$.

# Key ideas for stability theorem:

1) Semi-group approach
2) Use of DeTurck flow
3) Linearization of the DeTurck Flow
4) Verify "sectoriality" of the Lichnerowicz laplacian
5) Verify boundedness of the "resolvent" of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian
6) Verify that the RHS of the DeTurk flow is continuous, and has a Frechet
derivative with is Lipschitz.
7) Verify the diffeomorphism relationg ricci flow and deturk flow is bounded.

If $g_0$ converges to $g_\infty$, and $g_1$ is near $g_0$, then $g_1$ remains
close to $g_0$ and so must also converge.
