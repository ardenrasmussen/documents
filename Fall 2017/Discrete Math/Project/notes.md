# Notes

-   The first proof was made in 1976
    -   This proof was done with the assistance of computers. This was extreamly
          contravercial as no computer assisted proofs have been made yet.
    -   The logic of the proof could be checked by other researchers, but the
          validity of the code could not as easily be checked. This was the cause
          of major contraversy.
-   Due to the contraversy of the initial proof, many attempts at a falsifying
      proof have been made, but none have been successful.
-   Further improvements to the original proof have been made, reducing the
      number of graphs that need to be computationaly checked, but as it stands
      computers are still neccesary to check the base set of graphs.
-   The theorm of **The Four Color Problem** is that for any _map_ or _planar
      graph_ one can color all of the faces with only four colors, dispite any
      complexities of the edges and boundries.
    -   It does not matter if the outer face is included or not.
