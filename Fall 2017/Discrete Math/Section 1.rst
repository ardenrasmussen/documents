Addition Principle
------------------

We have a task that can be done by several (mutually exclusive) methods. The
sum of the number of ways for each method if the solution.

Multiplication Principle
------------------------

We have a task that can be done by a series of (independent) sub tasks. The
product of the number of options for each sub task is the solution.
