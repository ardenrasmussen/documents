I have really enjoyed the introduction of yoga into my daily life. However, at
the begging of the course, it was difficult to find a time when I was able to
regularly set aside some time to do it. My mornings are usually too busy as I
have an 8am class, and I was not accustom to setting aside time in the
afternoon/evening. It took me a couple of weeks to really develop a good time
to do my yoga. I have decided that when I get home, before dinner is the best
time for me to take a break and do some yoga.

I find that yoga has become a great way to relax and decompress after a long
day of classes, and I have really come to appreciate and look forward to my
daily yoga when I get home. I find that spending the time to align my thoughts
and take some time to clear my mind and not worry about the work that I may need
to do is extremely beneficial for me, and helps me stay focused on my work
afterwards.

I have regularly been meditating daily for the past two years, so getting into
a good state of mid for yoga, is not too difficult for me. But the most
difficult parts for me are the balancing poses. I do not have the best
balance, so I have been focusing on trying to improve those poses during my
daily yoga.

I find that the back stretches are the most beneficial for me, as my posture is
not very good, and I need to more actively work on improving it. So I try to
spend some extra time on the poses that stretch my spine, as I find that those
are the most beneficial for me. I plan on spending the second half of the
semester working on actively improving my posture, so that my spine is more
aligned regularly.
