The Mahayana school of philosophy critiqued the Abhidharma explication of
reality, primary the concept of all of reality being constructed of collections
of dhammas. The Abhidharma teaching very heavily focused on the concept of
anatman, and the fact that there is no eternal self. One of the other primary
teachings was that of conditioned arising (pratitya samutpada), this is the
concept that nothing just exists, but it instead arises due to conditions
caused by other things.

With these two concepts the Adhidharma school of philosophy was that there is
nothing except for the dhammas, and all other components of reality are some
combination of dhammas, and are caused by conditioned arising. The main issue
that the Madhyamaka school of though had with the Adhidharma school was that if
nothing exists and there is no self, then how do the dhammas exist?

If the dhammas exist outside of conditioned arising, then they are eternal,
and could be considered to have a self. However, this is contradictory to the
primary teaching of anatman. This would imply that the dhammas exist outside of
conditioned arising, and that they poses an eternal essence, or a self.

The Madhyamika interpretation of conditioned arising is that phenomena are not
only dependent for their arising, but also in their very nature. A phenomena
can only be considered in relation to other phenomena and how they interact
(Harvey 118). Thus the dhammas cannot exist on their own, but must arise from
given conditions, and can only be considered in relation to other phenomena,
and cannot be considered on its own.

The Mahayana school of philosophy developed a solution to this, by declaring
that everything is subject to conditioned arising. That is including the
dhammas, and Nirvana. This school of thought considered that even the dhammas
were conditions of a more basic principal. Thus they developed their "universal
truth" which consists of a number of most basic components, that are combined
to construct everything. This includes the dhammas of the Adhidharma schools of
thought.

Nagarjuna argues that the teaching of the Mahayana school is a middle way in
the sense that "something with inherent existence would substantially exist and
be eternal; to believe in such an eternity is to hold to the eternalism view,
while to believe that such a thing could go out of existence is to hold to the
annihilationist view" (Harvey 118). Here he says that any thing that has
inherit existence, such as the dhammas in the Adhidharma school, would lead to
an eternalism view, which was condemned by the Buddha, and is counter
productive for the progression towards enlightenment.

The Mahayana school considered the dhammas as a "convent truth", such that is
was convenient to use the terminology for discussion, but under scrutiny it
does not withstand as the "ultimate truth" would.
