Chapter 3 of *The Lotus Sutra*, is titled "Parable", and in it the Buddha, uses
the parable of a burring house to explain the three paths to enlightenment. The
primary vehicle is the bodhisattva vehicle, which leads to complete
enlightenment and becoming a Buddha, then there is the sravaka and
patyekabuddha vehicles, which were previously considered lesser than the
bodhisattva vehicle. 

In the parable, the Buddha describes the tale of a house burring down around
three children. In this parable the burring house is intended to represent
Samsara, with all of its dangers and issues, and the children represent
sentient beings. It is important to note, that without the prompting of the
children's father, they are ignorant of the danger they are in just as sentient
beings are ignorant to the dangers of samsara without the Buddhas teachings.

Then even with the Buddhas teachings, warning the children of the dangers of
staying in the house, they do not leave. It is not until the father tells the
children of the three carts. The father tells the children of three great
carts, one is ox draw, one is deer drawn, and one is goat drawn. Theses three
carts are representative of the three vehicles for enlightenment. He states "If
these children are resolute, ... they can become pratyekabuddhas or
bodhisattvas" (57). These three carts that the Buddha tells the children
of, each represent a different vehicle for enlightenment. And different
children will be most "excited" by different carts. That is why there is
three, as some will be most attentive to the goat cart, others the dear cart,
and some the ox cart.

However, as it turns out, there is only three ox carts waiting for the children
"There were large white oxen, Healthy and powerful with beautiful bodies, Yoked
to the jeweled carts" (55). The ox cart is representative of the
bodhisattva vehicle. This extract explains that there is only one true vehicle
of the bodhisattva vehicle, and the Buddha later states "I make the
bodhisattvas as well as sravakas Board this jeweled vehicle" (57). This
makes it clear that all the children of the Buddha (or the father), are all
provided the best possible vehicle of the bodhisattva vehicle (or the ox cart).

This parable explains that all of the teachings of the Buddha, including the
different vehicles which can be followed to attain enlightenment has all been a
skillful mean to attract people to escape from the burning Samsara. Each
vehicle attracts a different type of sentient being, and although there is only
one true cart, claiming that there are lesser carts, allows more sentient
beings to escape from the burning house, and achieve enlightenment. No matter
what path a sentient being follows to achieve enlightenment, they are all
actually equal, it is just a means to attract more being to begin along the
path. As if there were only the bodhisattva path, many sentient beings may be
too intimidated, and so by claiming to have lesser paths, but still leading
them on the greater path is the only way to help them escape Samsara.
