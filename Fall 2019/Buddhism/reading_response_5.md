In Queen's article "Dr. Ambedkar and the Hermeneutics of Buddhism Liberation",
Queen first introduces Berger's description of modernity. This is given as

> For premodern man, heresy is a possibility -- usually a rather remote one;
> for modern man, heresy typically becomes a necessity... Modernity creates a
> new situation in which picking and choosing becomes an imperative.

Here Berger describes that in premodern society, one was often born into a
religion, nd it was difficult if not impossible to change ones religion, or for
that matter make any real decisions about their life. And he defines modernity
as a society where picking ones religion is practically a necessity, one is
no longer obligated to continue with the religion of ones parents, but has the
opportunity to search through all the religions of the world and select the best
religion for their point of view.

This definition of modernity, and a modern person, being one who takes part in
makeing these decisions, and using their ability to select a religion to
preceed in to research and eventualy an educated choice as to which religion to
follow.

By this definition Bhimarao Ramji Ambedkar is a prime example of a modern man,
and clearly demonstrates the modernity of the time. Ambedkar began life,
according to Berger, as a premodern man. He inherited Hinduism, in a society
which relativly locked him in his social class, as Queen states "As a member of
the lowly Mahar community, required by Hindu law to preform menial work and
avoid polluting contact with the upper classes". This is a clear example that
Ambedkar's early life was inded relativly predetermined, and did not provide
many if any choices for him to make. His social standing from birth already
determined his potential employment, he did not have the ability to make any
choices in this stance, and thus it becomes clear that Ambedkar did indeed
begin life in premodernity, according to Bergers definition of modernity.

However, Ambedkar grown up to break out of this premodern society, and becomes
a prime example of Berger's modern man. Ambedkar rejected Hinduism, and upon
leading the Untouchables leading up to Indian independence, he began in through
research into different possible religions that he could select from. And after
through research he decides on and adopts Buddhism as his faith. Queen states
this succinctly "one who rejected the sacred canopy of Hinduism, systematically
studied the religious options available in India, and finally adopted
Buddhism". Queen even later states "deliberately choosing a religious faith from
among the competing traditions in a richly pluralistic society". From theses
two excerpts from Queen, it is clear that Ambedkar did indeed become a modern
man. He made an informed decision and used his freedom to select his own faith
to adopt Buddhism, even with many other choices that he could have selected, he
utilized his privilege as a modern man to select the faith that aligned most with
his criteria.
