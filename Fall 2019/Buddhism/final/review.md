# Short Answers

## "Nature" in Asian Buddhist cultures

The linkage between Native American culture and Buddhism. Thoreau established
nature as pure wildness, and connected Buddhism to the preservation of this
wilderness. This inspired people to connect gameness Buddhism with nature. Zen
Buddhism connects with shamanism. In Asia Buddhism is not seen as a religion
of nature, it is more commonly dominating nature, and how nature is dangerous.

## Thich Nhat Hanh's "miracle of walking on earth"

The real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on
earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize: a
blue sky , white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious as of a child--our
own two eyes. All is a  miracle.

## Examples of Buddhism as a bridge between Enlightenment rationality and Romanticism in the West

Thoreau and Van Gogh two romantics connect with Buddhism. American Buddhism has
been altered to be very scientific and rational, so the connection of romantics
and rational science are though Buddhism.

## Goals of Buddhist practice for the Tibetan vs. Western nuns in the film "Blessings"

Western nuns have more choice in what they become, and their goals are for
personal gain, and personal happiness. The goals of the Tibetan nuns was to
help all sentient bingen.

## B.T. Ambedkar's criteria for determining "the authentic word few the Buddha," and what he left out

Ambedkar omitted the emphasis on monastic life, and the more faith based
religious practices, making his Buddhism more scientific. He thought that faith
must foster morality in accord with scientific reason, offer liberty, equality,
and fraternity. He considered the things he omitted as misguided interpolation
of monastic editors.

## Conflicts with Westerners identified as tulku

In easter society being identified as a talk is an honor, and parents are
happy to give up their child to a monastery, but in the west this is not the
case, people don't want to lose their child to a far away land.

# Essay

## “Domestication” of Buddhism
Miracle tales related to the Lotus Sutra and various bodhisattvas were an
example of the ways in which an Indian religion was “domesticated” into East
Asian cultures (that of China and Japan). Buddhism has transformed in its
encounter with the West as well, as we saw in the case of American Buddhist
environmentalism.  In this essay, I want you to discuss how Buddhism was
transformed (a) through its encounter with pre-existing Chinese cultural norms
and concerns (e.g., Confucian filial piety), and (b) though its encounter with
20th-century Americans concerned with valuing and preserving “nature,” as they
understood it.

Support your interpretation with specific examples.

(Relevant readings for (a) would be the "Darani Sutra of the Five Mudras" in
Norton Anthology, including the editor's introduction to the primary text, and
Harvey, Introduction to Buddhism pages 210-213 and 250-254. For (b) look at
William Bodiford's "Buddhist Ecological Thought and Action in North America, in
the Course Reader.)

* Buddhism transfer to Chinese cultrue, incorporated confucian filial piety, by
providing sutras that would result in the birth of a son, in only three days,
specifically a son. Then there was the transformation of Avaloketeshvara to
Guanyen becoming a women, to align with the Chinese faiths having a woman
deity. Then the miraculous tales where used to show the power of Buddhism in
the here and now, demonstrating that its powers were not only present far away.
* Its transition to America changed it more dramatically, American was a bit
more dramatic. Americans made the religion more scientific, and frequently
removed much of the monastic component's.

## East vs. West

Gary Snyder once said: “The mercy [spiritual strength] of the West has been
social revolution; the mercy of the East has been individual insight into the
void.  We need both” (quoted in Bodiford, 21).  What motivated Gary Snyder’s
interest in and interpretation of Buddhism?  Does this division of “East” vs.
“West” apply to B.R. Ambedkar?   What aspects of Ambedkar’s novel approach to
Buddhism seem characteristically modern – and thus, in some way, “Western”?

A useful format for this essay might be:

* 1-2 introductory sentences
* Paragraph on Snyder’s interest in and interpretation of Buddhism
* Paragraph on B.R. Ambedkar’s interest in and interpretation of Buddhism
* Paragraph with analysis of what is “modern” about each of their
    interpretations, how “modernism” relates to East vs. West, etc.

Support your interpretation with specific examples.
