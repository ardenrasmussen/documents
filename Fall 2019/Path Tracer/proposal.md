# Proposal #
### Arden Rasmussen ###

The primary goal of this independent study is to develop an understanding
for computer graphics path rendering techniques.

I will develop a library that can be used by others that makes use of path
tracing, and some additional advanced rendering techniques. The library should
at a minimum be able to utilize path tracing to render a user defined scene.

I will meet with my supervisor weekly to discuss the progress that I have made,
my performance will be evaluated at the end of the semester, based upon the
code that I have written.

I will present a library, and write a paper on the process that I have learned
about. The final test will be if my code is able to use path tracing to render
several scenes that the supervisor has defined.

We will meet weekly, and be able to email each other if other situations arise.
