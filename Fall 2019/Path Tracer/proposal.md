# Proposal #
### Arden Rasmussen ###

The primary goal of this independents study is to develop and understand the
industry standard methods for computer graphics rendering. Specifically
rendering techniques using path tracing.

I will develop a library that can be used by others that makes use of path
tracing, and some additional advanced rendering techniques. The library should
at a minimum be able to utilize path tracing to render a user defined scene.

I will meet with my supervisor weekly to discuss the progress that I have made,
my performance will be evaluated at the end of the semester, based upon the
code that I have written.

I will present a library, and write a paper on the process that I have learned
about.

We will meet weekly, and be able to email each other if other situations arise.
