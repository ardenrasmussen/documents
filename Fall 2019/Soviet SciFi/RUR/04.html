        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes, they get used up. 

        <p>[<em>Enter</em> MARIUS.]</p>

        <p align="left">Marius, bring in samples of the Manual Labor Robot. (<em>Exit</em> 

          MARIUS.) </p>

        <p align="left">I'll show you specimens of the two extremes. This first 

          grade is comparatively inexpensive and is made in vast quantities. </p>

        <p>[MARIUS <em>reenters with two Manual Labor Robots.</em>]</p>

        <p align="left">There you are; as powerful as a small tractor. Guaranteed 

          to have average intelligence. That will do, Marius. (MARIUS <em>exits 

          with Robots.</em>) </p>

      </div>

      <p align="left">HELENA. They make me feel so strange.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN <em>(rings). </em>Did you see my new typist? (<em>He 

        rings for</em> SULLA)</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. I didn't notice her.</p>

      <p align="center">[<em>Enter</em> SULLA.]</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Sulla, let Miss Glory see you.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. So pleased to meet you. You must find it terribly 

        dull in this out-of-the-way spot, don't you?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. I don't know, Miss Glory.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Where do you come from?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. From the factory.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, you were born there?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. I was made there.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. What?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>laughing</em>). Sulla is a Robot, best grade.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, I beg your pardon.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Sulla isn't angry. See, Miss Glory, the kind of skin 

        we make. (<em>Feels the skin on</em> SULLA'S <em>face.</em>) Feel her 

        face.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Ah, no, no.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. You wouldn't know that she's made of different material 

        from us, would you? Turn round, Sulla.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, stop, stop.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Talk to Miss Glory, Sulla.</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. Please sit down. (HELENA <em>sits.</em>) Did you 

        have a pleasant crossing?</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, yes, certainly.</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. Don't go back on the <em>Amelia, </em>Miss Glory. 

        The barometer is falling steadily. Wait for the <em>Pennsylvania. </em>That's 

        a good, powerful vessel.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. What's its speed?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. Twenty knots. Fifty thousand tons. Captain Harpy, 

        eight boilers-- </p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. That'll do Sulla. Now show us your knowledge of French.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. You know French?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. I know four languages. I can write: Dear Sir, Monsieur, 

        Geehrter Herr, Cteny pane.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA (<em>jumping up</em>). Oh, that's absurd! Sulla isn't 

        a Robot. Sulla is a girl like me. Sulla, this is outrageous! Why do you 

        take part in such a hoax?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. I am a Robot.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA No, no, you are not telling the truth. I know they've 

        forced you to do it for an advertisement. Sulla, you are a girl like me, 

        aren't you?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. I'm sorry, Miss Glory. Sulla is a Robot.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. It's a lie!</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. What? (<em>Rings.</em>) Excuse me, Miss Glory, then 

        I must convince you.</p>

      <div align="center">[<em>Enter</em> MARIUS.] </div>

      <p align="left">Marius, take Sulla into the dissecting room, and tell them 

        to open her up at once.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Where?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Into the dissecting room. When they've cut her open, 

        you can go and have a look.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. No, no!</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Excuse me, you spoke of lies.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. You wouldn't have her killed?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. You can't kill machines.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Don't be afraid, Sulla; I won't let you go. Tell 

        me, my dear, are they always so cruel to you? You mustn't put up with 

        it, Sulla. You mustn't.</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. I am a Robot.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. That doesn't matter. Robots are just as good as 

        we are. Sulla, you wouldn't let yourself be cut to pieces?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. Yes.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, you're not afraid of death, then?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. I cannot tell, Miss Glory.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Do you know what would happen to you in there?</p>

      <p align="left">SULLA. Yes, I should cease to move.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. How dreadful!</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Marius, tell Miss Glory what you are.</p>

      <p align="left">MARIUS. Marius, the Robot.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Would you take Sulla into the dissecting room?</p>

      <p align="left">MARIUS. Yes.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN, Would you be sorry for her?</p>

      <p align="left">MARIUS. I cannot tell.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. She would cease to move. They would put her into 

        the stamping mill.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. That is death, Marius. Aren't you afraid of death?</p>

      <p align="left">MARIUS. No.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. You see, Miss Glory, the Robots have no interest 

        in life. They have no enjoyments. They are less than so much grass.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, stop. Send them away.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Marius, Sulla, you may go.</p>

      <p align="center">[<em>Exeunt</em> SULLA and MARIUS.]</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. How terrible! It's outrageous what you are doing.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Why outrageous?</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. I don't know, but it is. Why do you call her Sulla?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Isn't it a nice name?</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. It's a man's name. Sulla was a Roman general.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Oh, we thought that Marius and Sulla were lovers.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Marius and Sulla were generals and fought against 

        each other in the year-- I've forgotten now.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Come here to the window.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. What?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Come here. What do you see?</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Bricklayers.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Robots. All our work people are Robots. And down 

        there, can you see anything?</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Some sort of office.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. A countinghouse. And in it-- </p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. A lot of officials.</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Robots. All our officials are Robots. And when you 

        see the factory-- (<em>Factory whistle blows.</em>) Noon. We have to blow 

        the whistle because the Robots don't know when to stop work. In two hours 

        I will show you the kneading trough.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Kneading trough?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. The pestle for beating up the paste. In each one 

        we mix the ingredients for a thousand Robots at one operation. Then there 

        are the vats for the preparation of liver, brains, and so on. Then you 

        will see the bone factory. After that I'll show you the spinning mill.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Spinning mill?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes. For weaving nerves and veins. Miles and miles 

        of digestive tubes pass through it at a time.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. Mayn't we talk about something else?</p>

      <p align="left">DOMIN. Perhaps it would be better. There's only a handful 

        of us among a hundred thousand Robots, and not one woman. We talk about 

        nothing but the factory all day, every day. It's just as if we were under 

        a curse, Miss Glory.</p>

      <p align="left">HELENA. I'm sorry I said you were lying. (<em>A knock at 

        the door.</em>) </p>
