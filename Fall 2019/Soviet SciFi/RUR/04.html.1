      <p>HELENA. Nana, Nana! 

      <div align="center">[NANA <em>entering from the left.</em>]</div>

      Is Radius still there?

      <p></p>

      <p>NANA. The one who went mad? They haven't come for him yet.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Is he still raving?</p>

      <p>NANA. No. He's tied up.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Please bring him here. Nana. (<em>Exit NANA.</em>) (<em>Goes 

        to telephone.</em>) Hello, Dr. Gall, please. Oh, good day, Doctor. Yes, 

        it's Helena. Thanks for your lovely present. Could you come and see me 

        right away? It's important. Thank you.</p>

      <div align="center">[NANA <em>brings in</em> RADIUS.]</div>

      <p>Poor Radius, you've caught it too? Now they'll send you to the stamping 

        mill. Couldn't you control yourself? Why did it happen? You see, Radius, 

        you are more intelligent than the rest. Dr. Gall took such trouble to 

        make you different. Won't you speak?</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Send me to the stamping mill.</p>

      <p>HELENA. But I don't want them to kill you. What was the trouble,Radius?</p>

      <p>RADIUS. I won't work for you. Put me into the stamping mill. HELENA. 

        Do you hate us? Why?</p>

      <p>RADIUS. You are not as strong as the Robots. The Robots can do everything. 

        You only give orders. You do nothing but talk.</p>

      <p>HELENA. But someone must give orders.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. I don't want any master. I know everything for myself.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Radius, Dr. Gall gave you a better brain than the rest, better 

        than ours. You are the only one of the Robots that understands perfectly. 

        That's why I had you put into the library, so that you could read everything, 

        understand everything, and then-- oh, Radius, I wanted you to show the 

        whole world that the Robots are our equals. That's what I want of you.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. I don't want a master. I want to be master. I want to be master 

        over others.</p>

      <p>HELENA. I'm sure they'd put you in charge of many Robots, Radius. You 

        would be a teacher of the Robots.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. I want to be master over people.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>staggering</em>) You are mad.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Then send me to the stamping mill.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Do you think we're afraid of you?</p>

      <p>RADIUS. What are you going to do? What are you going to do?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Radius, give this note to Mr. Domin. It asks them not to send 

        you to the stamping mill. I'm sorry you hate us so.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">[DR GALL<em> enters the room.</em>]</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. You wanted me?</p>

      <p>HELENA. It's about Radius, Doctor. He had an attack this morning. He 

        smashed the statues downstairs.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. What a pity to lose him.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Radius isn't going to be put in the stamping mill.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. But every Robot after he has an attack-- it's a strict order.</p>

      <p>HELENA. No matter-- Radius isn't going if I can prevent it.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. I warn you. It's dangerous. Come here to the window, my good 

        fellow. Let's have a look. Please give me a needle or a pin.</p>

      <p>DR GALL. A test. (<em>Sticks it into the hand of </em>RADIUS, <em>who 

        gives a violent start.</em>) Gently, gently. (<em>Opens the jacket of</em> 

        RADIUS,<em> and puts his ear to his heart.</em>) Radius, you are going 

        into the stamping mill, do you understand? There they'll kill you, and 

        grind you to powder. That's terribly painful; it will make you scream 

        aloud.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, Doctor-- </p>

      <p>DR. GALL. No, no, Radius, I was wrong. I forgot that Madame Domin</p>

      <p>has put in a good word for you, and you'll be let off. Do you understand? 

        Ah! That makes a difference, doesn't it? All right. You can go.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. You do unnecessary things. (RADIUS <em>returns to the library.</em>) 

      </p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Reaction of the pupils; increase of sensitiveness. It wasn't 

        an attack characteristic of the Robots.</p>

      <p>HELENA What was it, then?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Heaven knows. Stubbornness, anger, or revolt-- I don't know. 

        And his heart, too!</p>

      <p>HELENA. What?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. It was fluttering with nervousness like a human heart. He was 

        all in a sweat with fear, and-- do you know, I don't believe the rascal 

        is a Robot at all any longer.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Doctor, has Radius a soul?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. He's got something nasty.</p>

      <p>HELENA. If you knew how he hates us! Oh, Doctor, are all your Robots 

        like that? All the new ones that you began to make in a different way?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Well, some are more sensitive than others. They're all more 

        like human beings than Rossum's Robots were.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Perhaps this hatred is more than like human beings, too?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. That, too, is progress.</p>

      <p>HELENA. What became of the girl you made, the one who was most like us?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Your favorite? I kept her. She's lovely, but stupid. No good 

        for work.</p>

      <p>HELENA. But she's so beautiful.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. I called her Helena. I wanted her to resemble you. But she's 

        a failure.</p>

      <p>HELENA. In what way?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. She goes about as if in a dream, remote and listless. She's 

        without life. I watch and wait for a miracle to happen. Sometimes I think 

        to myself, "If you were to wake up only for a moment you will kill me 

        for having made you."</p>

      <p>HELENA. And yet you go on making Robots! Why are no more children being 

        born?</p>

      <p>DR GALL We don't know.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, but you must. Tell me.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. You see, so many Robots are being manufactured that people 

        are becoming superfluous; man is really a survival. But that he should 

        begin to die out, after a paltry thirty years of competition! That's the 

        awful part of it. You might think that nature was offended at the manufacture 

        of the Robots. All the universities are sending in long petitions to restrict 

        their production. Otherwise, they say, mankind will become extinct through 

        lack of fertility. But the R. U. R. shareholders, of course, won't hear 

        of it. All the governments, on the other hand, are clamoring for an increase 

        in production, to raise the standards of their armies. And all the manufacturers 

        in the world are ordering Robots like mad.</p>

      <p>HELENA. And has no one demanded that the manufacture should cease altogether?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. No one has the courage.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Courage!</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. People would stone him to death. You see, after all, it's more 

        convenient to get your work done by the Robots.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, Doctor, what's going to become of people?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. God knows, Madame Helena, it looks to us scientists like the 

        end!</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>rising</em>). Thank you for coming and telling me.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. That means you're sending me away?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Yes. (Exit DR. GALL.)</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>with sudden resolution</em>). Nana, Nana! The fire, light 

        it quickly. (HELENA rushes into DOMIN'S room.)</p>

      <p>NANA (<em>entering from left.</em>) What, light the fire in summer? Has 

        that mad Radius gone? A fire in summer, what an idea! Nobody would think 

        she'd been married for ten years. She's like a baby, no sense at all. 

        A fire in summer! Like a baby.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>returns from right, with armful of faded papers</em>). Is 

        it burning, Nana? All this has got to be burned.</p>

      <p>NANA. What's that?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Old papers, fearfully old. Nana, shall I burn them?</p>

      <p>NANA. Are they any use?</p>

      <p>HELENA. No.</p>

      <p>NANA. Well, then, burn them.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>throwing the first sheet on the fire</em>). What would you 

        say, Nana, if this was money, a lot of money?</p>

      <p>NANA. I'd say burn it. A lot of money is a bad thing.</p>

      <p>HELENA. And if it was an invention, the greatest invention in the world?</p>

      <p>NANA. I'd say burn it. All these newfangled things are an offense to 

        the Lord. It's downright wickedness. Wanting to improve the world after 

        He has made it.</p>

      <p>HELENA Look how they curl up! As if they were alive. Oh, Nana, how horrible!</p>

      <p>NANA. Here, let me burn them.</p>

      <p>HELENA. No, no, I must do it myself. Just look at the flames. They are 

        like hands, like tongues, like living shapes. (<em>Raking fire with the 

        poker.</em>) Lie down, lie down.</p>

      <p>NANA. That's the end of them.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>standing up horror-stricken</em>). Nana, Nana!</p>

      <p>NANA. Good gracious, what is it you've burned?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Whatever have I done?</p>

      <p>NANA. Well, what was it? (<em>Men's laughter off left.</em>)</p>
