        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>observes HELENA with rapture, and reels off 

          rapidly). </em>It was in the year 1920 that old Rossum, the great physiologist, 

          who was then quite a young scientist, took himself to this distant island 

          for the purpose of studying the ocean fauna, full stop. On this occasion 

          he attempted by chemical synthesis to imitate the living matter known 

          as protoplasm until he suddenly discovered a substance which behaved 

          exactly like living matter although its chemical composition was different. 

          That was in the year of 1932, exactly four hundred and forty years after 

          the discovery of America. Whew!</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Do you know that by heart?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes. You see, physiology is not in my line. Shall 

          I go on?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Yes, please.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. And then, Miss Glory, old Rossum wrote the following 

          among his chemical specimens: "Nature has found only one method of organizing 

          living matter. There is, however, another method, more simple, flexible 

          and rapid, which has not yet occurred to nature at all. This second 

          process by which life can be developed was discovered by me today." 

          Now imagine him, Miss Glory, writing those wonderful words over some 

          colloidal mess that a dog wouldn't look at. Imagine him sitting over 

          a test tube, and thinking how the whole tree of life would grow from 

          it, how all animals would proceed from it, beginning with some sort 

          of beetle and ending with a man. A man of different substance from us. 

          Miss Glory, that was a tremendous moment.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Well?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Now, the thing was how to get the life out of the 

          test tubes, and hasten development and form organs, bones and nerves 

          and so on, and find such substances as catalytics, enzymes, hormones, 

          and so forth, in short-- you understand?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Not much, I'm afraid.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Never mind. You see, with the help of his tinctures 

          he could make whatever he wanted. He could have produced a Medusa with 

          the brain of a Socrates or a worm fifty yards long. But being without 

          a grain of humor, he took it into his head to make a vertebrate or perhaps 

          a man. This artificial living matter of his had a raging thirst for 

          life. It didn't mind being sewn or mixed together. That couldn't be 

          done with natural albumen. And that's how he set about it.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. About what?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. About imitating nature. First of all he tried making 

          an artificial dog. That took him several years, and resulted in a sort 

          of stunted calf which died in a few days. I'll show it to you in the 

          museum. And then old Rossum started on the manufacture of man.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. And I must divulge this to nobody?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. To nobody in the world.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What a pity that it's to be found in all the schoolbooks 

          of both Europe and America.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes. But do you know what isn't in the schoolbooks? 

          That old Rossum was mad. Seriously, Miss Glory, you must keep this to 

          yourself. The old crank wanted to actually make people.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But you do make people.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Approximately, Miss Glory. But old Rossum meant 

          it literally. He wanted to become a sort of scientific substitute for 

          God. He was a fearful materialist, and that's why he did it all. His 

          sole purpose was nothing more or less than to prove that God was no 

          longer necessary. Do you know anything about anatomy?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Very little.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Neither do I. Well, he then decided to manufacture 

          everything as in the human body. I'll show you in the museum the bungling 

          attempt it took him ten years to produce. It was to have been a man, 

          but it lived for three days only. Then up came young Rossum, an engineer. 

          He was a wonderful fellow, Miss Glory. When he saw what a mess of it 

          the old man was making, he said: "It's absurd to spend ten years making 

          a man. If you can't make him quicker than nature, you might as well 

          shut up shop." Then he set about learning anatomy himself</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. There's nothing about that in the schoolbooks.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. No. The schoolbooks are full of paid advertisements, 

          and rubbish at that. What the schoolbooks say about the united efforts 

          of the two great Rossums is all a fairy tale. They used to have dreadful 

          rows. The old atheist hadn't the slightest conception of industrial 

          matters, and the end of it was that young Rossum shut him up in some 

          laboratory or other and let him fritter the time away with his monstrosities, 

          while he himself started on the business from an engineer's point of 

          view. Old Rossum cursed him, and before he died he managed to botch 

          up two physiological honors. Then one day they found him dead in the 

          laboratory. And that's his whole story.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. And what about the young man?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Well, anyone who has looked into human anatomy 

          will have seen at once that man is too complicated, and that a good 

          engineer could make him more simply. So young Rossum began to overhaul 

          anatomy and tried to see what could be left out or simplified. In short-- 

          but this isn't boring you, Miss Glory?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. No indeed. You're-- it's awfully interesting.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. So young Rossum said to himself: "A man is something 

          that feels happy, plays the piano, likes going for a walk, and in fact 

          wants to do a whole lot of things that are really unnecessary.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Oh.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. That are unnecessary when he wants, let us say, 

          to weave or count. Do you play the piano?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Yes.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. That's good. But a working machine must not play 

          the piano, must not feel happy, must not do a whole lot of other things. 

          A gasoline motor must not have tassels or ornaments, Miss Glory. And 

          to manufacture artificial workers is the same thing as to manufacture 

          gasoline motors. The process must be of the simplest, and the product 

          of the best from a practical point of view. What sort of worker do you 

          think is the best from a practical point of view?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. What sort of worker do you think is the best from 

          a practical point of view?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Perhaps the one who is most honest and hard-working.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. No; the one that is the cheapest. The one whose 

          requirements are the smallest. Young Rossum invented a worker with the 

          minimum amount of requirements. He had to simplify him. He rejected 

          everything that did not contribute directly to the progress of work-- 

          everything that makes man more expensive. In fact, he rejected man and 

          made the Robot. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not people. Mechanically 

          they are more perfect than we are; they have an enormously developed 

          intelligence, but they have no soul.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. How do you know they've no soul?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Have you ever seen what a Robot looks like inside?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. No.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Very neat, very simple. Really, a beautiful piece 

          of work. Not much in it, but everything in flawless order. The product 

          of an engineer is technically at a higher pitch of perfection than a 

          product of nature.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But man is supposed to be the product of God.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. All the worse. God hasn't the least notion of modern 

          engineering. Would you believe that young Rossum then proceeded to play 

          at being God?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. How do you mean?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. He began to manufacture Super-Robots. Regular giants 

          they were. He tried to make them twelve feet tall. But you wouldn't 

          believe what a failure they were.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. A failure?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes. For no reason at all their limbs used to keep 

          snapping off. Evidently our planet is too small for giants. Now we make 

          only Robots of normal size and of very high-class human finish.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I saw the first Robots at home. The town council 

          bought them for-- I mean engaged them for work.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Bought them, dear Miss Glory. Robots are bought 

          and sold.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA These were employed as street sweepers. I saw them 

          sweeping. They were so strange and quiet.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Rossum's Universal Robot factory doesn't produce 

          a uniform brand of Robots. We have Robots of finer and coarser grades. 

          The best will live about twenty-years. (<em>He rings for</em> MARIUS.)</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Then they die?</p>
