        <p align="left">DOMIN. Come in.</p>

        <p align="center">[<em>From the right enter</em> MR. FABRY, DR. GALL, 

          DR. HALLEMEIER, MR. ALQUIST.]</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. I beg your pardon, I hope we don't intrude. 

        </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Come in. Miss Glory, here are Alquist, Fabry, Gall, 

          Hallemeier.</p>

        <p align="left">This is President Glory's daughter.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. How do you do.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. We had no idea-- </p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Highly honored, I'm sure-- </p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Welcome, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">[BUSMAN <em>rushes in from the right.</em>]</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Hello, what's up?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Come in. Busman. This is Busman, Miss Glory. This 

          is President Glory's daughter.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. By Jove, that's fine! Miss Glory may we send a 

          cablegram to the papers about your arrival?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. No, no, please don't.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Sit down please, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Allow me-- (<em>Dragging up armchairs.</em>)</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Please-- </p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. Excuse me-- </p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. What sort of crossing did you have?</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Are you going to stay long?</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. What do you think of the factory, Miss Glory?</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. Did you come over on the <em>Amelia</em>?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Be quiet and let Miss Glory speak.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA (<em>to</em> DOMIN). What am I to speak to them 

          about?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Anything you like.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Shall may I speak quite frankly.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Why, of course.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA (<em>wavering, then in desperate resolution</em>). 

          Tell me, doesn't it ever distress you the way you are treated?</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. By whom, may I ask?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why, everybody.</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUJST. Treated?</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. What makes you think--?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Don't you feel that you might be living a better 

          life?</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Well, that depends on what you mean, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I mean that it's perfectly outrageous. It's terrible. 

          (<em>Standing up.</em>) The whole of Europe is talking about the way 

          you're being treated. That's why I came here, to see for myselt and 

          it's a thousand times worse than could have been imagined. How can you 

          put up with it?</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Put up with what?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Good heavens, you are living creatures, just like 

          us, like the whole of Europe, like the whole world. It's disgraceful 

          that you must live like this.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Good gracious, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. Well, she's not far wrong. We live here just like 

          red Indians.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Worse than red Indians. May I, oh, may I call 

          you brothers?</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Why not?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Brothers, I have not come here as the President's 

          daughter. I have come on behalf of the Humanity League. Brothers, the 

          Humanity League now has over two hundred thousand members. Two hundred 

          thousand people are on your side, and offer you their help.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Two hundred thousand people! Miss Glory, that's 

          a tidy lot. Not bad.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. I'm always telling you there's nothing like good 

          old Europe. You see, they've not forgotten us. They're offering us help.</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. What help? A theater, for instance?</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. An orchestra?</p>

        <p align="left">SELENA. More than that.</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Just you?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, never mind about me. I'll stay as Long as 

          it is necessary.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. By Jove, that's good.</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Domin, I'm going to get the best room ready for 

          Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Just a minute. I'm afraid that Miss Glory is of 

          the opinion that she has been talking to Robots.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Of course.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. I'm sorry. These gentlemen are human beings just 

          like us.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. You're not Robots?</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Not Robots.</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. Robots indeed!</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. No, thanks.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. Upon my honor, Miss Glory, we aren't Robots.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA (<em>to</em> DOMIN). Then why did you tell me that 

          all your officials are Robots?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes, the officials, but not the managers. Allow 

          me, Miss Glory: this is Mr. Fabry, General Technical Manager of R.U.R; 

          Dr. Gall, Head of the Physiological and Experimental Department; Dr. 

          Hallemeier, Head of the Institute for the Psychological Training of 

          Robots; Consul Busman, General Business Manager; and Alquist, Head of 

          the Building Department of R.U.R.</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Just a builder.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Excuse me, gentlemen, for-- for-- Have I done 

          something dreadful?</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Not at all, Miss Glory. Please sit down.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I'm a stupid girl. Send me back by the first ship.</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Not for anything in the world, Miss Glory. Why 

          should we send you back?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Because you know I've come to disturb your Robots 

          for you.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. My dear Miss Glory, we've had close upon a hundred 

          saviors and prophets here. Every ship brings us some. Missionaries, 

          anarchists, Salvation Army, all sorts. It's astonishing what a number 

          of churches and idiots there are in the world.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. And you let them speak to the Robots?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. So far we've let them all, why not? The Robots 

          remember everything, but that's all. They don't even laugh at what the 

          people say. Really, it is quite incredible. If it would amuse you, Miss 

          Glory, I'll take you over to the Robot warehouse. It holds about three 

          hundred thousand of them.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Three hundred and forty-seven thousand.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Good! And you can say whatever you like to them. 

          You can read the Bible, recite the multiplication table, whatever you 

          please. You can even preach to them about human rights.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, I think that if you were to show them a little 

          love-- </p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. Impossible, Miss Glory. Nothing is harder to like 

          than a Robot.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What do you make them for, then?</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Ha, ha, ha, that's good! What are Robots made 

          for?</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. For work, Miss Glory! One Robot can replace two 

          and a half workmen. The human machine, Miss Glory, was terribly imperfect. 

          It had to be removed sooner or later.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. It was too expensive.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. It was not effective. It no longer answers the 

          requirements of modern engineering. Nature has no idea of keeping pace 

          with modern labor. For example: from a technical point of view, the 

          whole of childhood is a sheer absurdity. So much time lost. And then 

          again-- </p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, no! No!</p>
