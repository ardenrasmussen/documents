Go quickly. It's the gentlemen coming.      <p>NANA. Good gracious, what a place! (<em>Exits.</em>)</p>      <p>DOMIN (<em>opens the door at left</em>). Come along and offer your congratulations.</p>      <p align="CENTER">[<em>Enter</em> HALLEMEIER <em>and</em> GALL.]</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Madame Helena, I congratulate you on this festive day.</p>      <p>HELENA. Thank you. Where are Fabry and Busman?</p>      <p>DOMIN. They've gone down to the harbor.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Friends we must drink to this happy occasion.</p>      <p>HELENA. Brandy?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Vitriol, if you like.</p>      <p>HELENA. With soda water? (<em>Exits.</em>)</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Let's be temperate. No soda.</p>      <p>DOMIN. What's been burning here? Well, shall I tell her about it?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Of course. It's all over now.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER (<em>embracing </em>DOMIN <em>and</em> DR.GALL). It's all         over now; it's all over now.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. It's all over now.</p>      <p>DOMIN. It's all over now.</p>      <p>HELENA. (<em>entering from left with decanter and glasses</em>). What's         all over now'? What's the matter with you all?</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. A piece of good luck, Madame Domin. Just ten years ago today         you arrived on this island.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. And now, ten years later to the minute-- </p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. --the same ship's returning to us. So here's to luck. That's         fine and strong.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Madame, your health.</p>      <p>HELENA. Which ship do you mean?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Any ship will do, as long as it arrives in time. To the ship,         boys. (<em>Empties his glass.</em>)</p>      <p>HELENA. You've been waiting for a ship?</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Rather. Like Robinson Crusoe. Madame Helena, best wishes.         Come along, Domin, out with the news.</p>      <p>HELENA. Do tell me what's happened.</p>      <p>DOMIN. First, it's all up.</p>      <p>HELENA. What's up?</p>      <p>DOMIN. The revolt.</p>      <p>HELENA. What revolt?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Give me the paper, Hallemeier. (<em>Reads.</em>) "The first national         Robot organization has been founded at Havre, and has issued an appeal         to the Robots throughout the world."</p>      <p>HELENA. I read that.</p>      <p>DOMIN. That means a revolution. A revolution of all the Robots in the         world.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. By Jove, I'd like to know-- </p>      <p>DOMIN. --who started it? So would I. There was nobody in the world who         could affect the Robots; no agitator, no one, and suddenly-- this happens,         if you please.</p>      <p>HELENA. What did they do?</p>      <p>DOMIN. They got possession of all firearms, telegraphs, radio stations,         railways, and ships.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. And don't forget that these rascals outnumbered us by at         least a thousand to one. A hundredth part of them would be enough to settle         us.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Remember that this news was brought by the last steamer. That         explains the stoppage of all communication, and the arrival of no more         ships. We knocked off work a few days ago, and we're just waiting to see         when things are to start afresh.</p>      <p>HELENA. Is that why you gave me a warship?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Oh, no, my dear, I ordered that six months ago, just to be on         the safe side. But upon my soul, I was sure then that we'd be on board         today.</p>      <p>HELENA. Why six months ago?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Well, there were signs, you know. But that's of no consequence.         To think that this week the whole of civilization has been at stake. Your         health, boys.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Your health, Madame Helena.</p>      <p>HELENA. You say it's all over?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Absolutely.</p>      <p>HELENA. How do you know?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. The boat's coming in. The regular mailboat, exact to the minute         by the timetable. It will dock punctually at eleven-thirty.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Punctuality is a fine thing, boys. That's what keeps the world         in order. Here's to punctuality.</p>      <p>HELENA. Then-- everything's-- all right?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Practically everything. I believe they've cut the cables and seized         the radio stations. But it doesn't matter if only the timetable holds         good.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. If the timetable holds good, human laws hold good; the laws         of the universe hold good; everything holds good that ought to hold good.         The timetable is more significant than the gospel; more than Homer, more         than the whole of Kant. The timetable is the most perfect product of the         human mind. Madame Domin, I'll fill up my glass.</p>      <p>HELENA. Why didn't you tell me anything about it?</p>
      <p>DR. GALL. Heaven forbid.</p>      <p>DOMIN. You mustn't be worried with such things.</p>      <p>HELENA. But if the revolution had spread as far as here?</p>      <p>DOMIN. You wouldn't know anything about it.</p>      <p>HELENA. Why?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Because we'd be on board your <em>Ultimus </em>and well out at         sea. Within a month, Helena, we'd be dictating our own terms to the Robots.</p>      <p>HELENA. I don't understand.</p>      <p>DOMIN. We'd take something away with us that the Robots could not exist         without.</p>      <p>HELENA. What, Harry?</p>      <p>DOMIN. The secret of their manufacture. Old Rossum's manuscript. As soon         as they found out that they couldn't make themselves they'd be on their         knees to us.</p>      <p>HELENA. Why didn't you tell me?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Why, the boat's in!</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Eleven-thirty to the dot. The good old <em>Amelia </em>that         brought Madame Helena to us.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Just ten years ago to the minute.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. They're throwing out the mailbags.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Busman's waiting for them. Fabry will bring us the first news.         You know, Helena, I'm fearfully curious to know how they tackled this         business in Europe.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. To think we weren't in it, we who invented the Robots!</p>      <p>HELENA. Harry!</p>      <p>DOMIN. What is it?</p>      <p>HELENA. Let's leave here.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Now, Helena? Oh, come, come!</p>      <p>HELENA. As quickly as possible, all of us!</p>      <p>DOMIN. Why?</p>      <p>HELENA. Please, Harry, please, Dr. Gall; Hallemeier, please close the         factory.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Why, none of us could leave here now.</p>      <p>HELENA. Why?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Because we're about to extend the manufacture of the Robots.</p>      <p>HELENA. What-- now-- now after the revolt?</p>      <p>DOMIN Yes, precisely, after the revolt. We're just beginning the manufacture         of a new kind.</p>      <p>HELENA. What kind?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Henceforward we shan't have just one factory. There won't be Universal         Robots any more. We'll establish a factory in every country, in every         State; and do you know what these new factories will make?</p>      <p>HELENA. No, what?</p>      <p>DOMIN. National Robots.</p>      <p>HELENA. How do you mean?</p>      <p>DOMIN. I mean that each of these factories will produce Robots of a different         color, a different language. They'll be complete strangers to each other.         They'll never be able to understand each other. Then we'll egg them on         a little in the matter of misunderstanding, and the result will be that         for ages to come every Robot will hate every other Robot of a different         factory mark.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. By Jove, we'll make Negro Robots and Swedish Robots and Italian         Robots and Chinese Robots and Czechoslovakian Robots, and then-- </p>      <p>HELENA. Harry, that's dreadful.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Madame Domin, here's to the hundred new factories, the National         Robots.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Helena, mankind can keep things going only for another hundred         years at the outside. For a hundred years men must be allowed to develop         and achieve the most they can.</p>      <p>HELENA. Oh, close the factory before it's too late.</p>      <p>DOMIN. I tell you we are just beginning on a bigger scale than ever.       </p>      <p align="CENTER">[<em>Enter</em> FABRY.]</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td><a href="/fiction/rur/act2/04.html">Back</a></td>    <td>       <div align="right"><a href="/fiction/rur/act2/06.html">Next</a></div>    </td>  </tr></table><p>
