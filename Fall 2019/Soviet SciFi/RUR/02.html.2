Look out, Bus, look out for the wires.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. What's that you're carrying?</p>      <p>BUSMAN (<em>going to table</em>). The ledgers, my boy! I'd like to wind         up the accounts before-- before-- well, this time I shan't wait till the         new year to strike a balance. What's up? (<em>Goes to the window.</em>)         Absolutely quiet.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Can't you see anything?</p>      <p>BUSMAN. Nothing but blue-- blue everywhere.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. That's the Robots. (BUSMAN <em>sits down at the table and opens         the ledgers.</em>)</p>      <p>DOMIN. The Robots are unloading firearms from the <em>Amelia</em>.</p>      <p>BUSMAN. Well, what of it? How can I stop them?</p>      <p>DOMIN. We can't stop them.</p>      <p>BUSMAN. Then let me go on with my accounts. (<em>Goes on with his work.</em>)</p>      <p>DOMIN (<em>picking up telescope and looking into the harbor</em>). Good         God, the <em>Ultimus</em> has trained her guns on us!</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Who's done <em>that</em>?</p>      <p>DOMIN. The Robots on board.</p>      <p>FABRY. H'm, then, of course, then-- then, that's the end of us.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. You mean?</p>      <p>FABRY. The Robots are practiced marksmen.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Yes. It's inevitable. (<em>Pause.</em>)</p>      <p>DR. GALL. It was criminal of old Europe to teach the Robots to fight.         Damn them! Couldn't they have given us a rest with their politics? It         was a crime to make soldiers of them.</p>      <p>ALQUIST. It was a crime to make Robots.</p>      <p>DOMIN. What?</p>      <p>ALQUIST. It was a crime to make Robots.</p>      <p>DOMIN. No, Alquist, I don't regret that even today.</p>      <p>ALQUIST. Not even today?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Not even today, the last day of civilization. It was a colossal         achievement.</p>      <p>BUSMAN (<em>sotto voce</em>). Three hundred sixty million.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Alquist, this is our last hour. We are already speaking half in         the other world. It was not an evil dream to shatter the servitude of         labor-- the dreadful and humiliating labor that man had to undergo. Work         was too hard. Life was too hard. And to overcome that-- </p>      <p>ALQUIST. Was not what the two Rossums dreamed of. Old Rossum only</p>      <p>thought of his Godless tricks and the young one of his millions. And         that's not what your R.U.R. shareholders dream of either. They dream of         dividends, and their dividends are the ruin of mankind.</p>      <p>DOMIN. To hell with your dividends! Do you suppose I'd have done an hour's         work for them? It was for myself that I worked, for my own satisfaction.         I wanted man to become the master, so that he shouldn't live merely for         a crust of bread. I wanted not a single soul to be broken by other people's         machinery. I wanted nothing, nothing, nothing to be left of this appalling         social structure. I'm revolted by poverty. I wanted a new generation.         I wanted-- I thought-- </p>      <p>ALQUIST. Well?</p>      <p>DOMIN. I wanted to turn the whole of mankind into an aristocracy of the         world. An aristocracy nourished by millions of mechanical slaves. Unrestricted,         free, and consummated in man. And maybe more than man.</p>      <p>ALQUIST. Superman?</p>      <p>DOMIN. Yes. Oh, only to have a hundred years of time! Another hundred         years for the future of mankind.</p>      <p>BUSMAN (<em>sotto voce</em>). Carried forward, four hundred and twenty         millions. (<em>The music stops.</em>)</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. What a fine thing music is! We ought to have gone in for         that before.</p>      <p>FABRY. Gone in for what?</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Beauty, lovely things. What a lot of lovely things there         are! The world was wonderful and we-- we here-- tell me, what enjoyment         did we have?</p>      <p>BUSMAN (<em>sotto voce</em>). Five hundred and twenty millions.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER (<em>at the window</em>). Life was a big thing. Life was--         Fabry, switch the current into that railing.</p>      <p>FABRY. Why?</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. They're grabbing hold of it.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Connect it up.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Fine! That's doubled them up! Two, three, four killed.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. They're retreating!</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Five killed!</p>      <p>DR. GALL. The first encounter!</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. They're charred to cinders, my boy. Who says we must give         up?</p>      <p>DOMIN (<em>wiping his forehead</em>). Perhaps we've been killed these         hundred years and are only ghosts. It's as if I had been through all this         before; as if I'd already had a mortal wound here in the throat. And you, 
        Fabry, had once been shot in the head. And you, Gall, torn limb from limb.         And Hallemeier knifed.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Fancy me being knifed. (<em>Pause.</em>) Why are you so quiet,         you fools. Speak, can't you?</p>      <p>ALQUIST. And who is to blame for all this?</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Nobody is to blame except the Robots.</p>      <p>ALQUIST. No, it is we who are to blame. You, Domin, myself, all of us.         For our own selfish ends, for profit, for progress, we have destroyed         mankind. Now we'll burst with all our greatness.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Rubbish, man. Mankind can't be wiped out so easily.</p>      <p>ALQUIST. It's our fault. It's our fault.</p>      <p>DR. GALL. No! I'm to blame for this, for everything that's happened.</p>      <p>FABRY. You, Gall?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. I changed the Robots.</p>      <p>BUSMAN. What's that?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. I changed the character of the Robots. I changed the way of         making them. Just a few details about their bodies. Chiefly-- chiefly,         their-- their irritability.</p>      <p>HALLEMEIER. Damn it, why?</p>      <p>BUSMAN. What did you do it for?</p>      <p>FABRY. Why didn't you say anything?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. I did it in secret. I was transforming them into human beings.         In certain respects they're already above us. They're stronger than we         are.</p>      <p>FABRY. And what's that got to do with the revolt of the Robots?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Everything, in my opinion. They've ceased to be machines. They're         already aware of their superiority, and they hate us. They hate all that         is human.</p>      <p>DOMIN. Perhaps we're only phantoms!</p>      <p>FABRY. Stop, Harry. We haven't much time! Dr. Gall!</p>      <p>DOMIN. Fabry, Fabry, how your forehead bleeds, where the shot pierced         it!</p>      <p>FABRY. Be silent! Dr. Gall, you admit changing the way of making the         Robots?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. Yes.</p>      <p>FABRY. Were you aware of what might be the consequences of your experiment?</p>      <p>DR. GALL. I was bound to reckon with such a possibility.</p>      <p align="CENTER">[HELENA <em>enters the drawing room from left.</em>]</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td><a href="/fiction/rur/act3/01.html">Back</a></td>    <td>       <div align="right"><a href="/fiction/rur/act3/03.html">Next</a></div>    </td>  </tr></table><p>
