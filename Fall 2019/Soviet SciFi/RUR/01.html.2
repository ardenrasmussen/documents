        <h2>THE SAME AFTERNOON</h2>

      <p>HELENA'S <em>drawing room as before.</em> DOMIN <em>comes into the room.</em> 

        DR.</p>

      <p>GALL <em>is looking out of the window, through closed shutters.</em> 

        ALQUIST <em>is seated down right.</em></p>

      <p>DOMIN. Any more of them?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Yes. There standing like a wall, beyond the garden railing. 

        Why are they so quiet? It's monstrous to be besieged with silence.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. I should like to know what they are waiting for. They must make 

        a start any minute now. If they lean against the railing they'll snap 

        it like a match.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. They aren't armed.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. We couldn't hold our own for five minutes. Man alive, they'd overwhelm 

        us like an avalanche. Why don't they make a rush for it? I say-- </p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Well?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. I'd like to know what would become of us in the next ten minutes. 

        They've got us in a vise. We're done for, Gall. (<em>Pause.</em>)</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. You know, we made one serious mistake.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. What?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. We made the Robots' faces too much alike. A hundred thousand 

        faces all alike, all facing this way. A hundred thousand expressionless 

        bubbles. It's like a nightmare.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. You think if they'd been different-- </p>

      <p>DR. GALL. It wouldn't have been such an awful sight!</p>

      <p>DOMIN (<em>looking through a telescope toward the harbor</em>). I'd like 

        to know what they unloading from the <em>Amelia</em>.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Not firearms.</p>

      <p>[FABRY <em>and</em> HALLEMEIER <em>rush into the room carrying electric 

        cables.</em>]</p>

      <p>FABRY. All right, Hallemeier, lay down that wire.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. That was a bit of work. What's the news?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. We're completely surrounded.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. We've barricaded the passage and the stairs. Any water here? 

        (<em>Drinks.</em>) God, what swarms of them! I don't like the looks of 

        them, Domin. There's a feeling of death about it all.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Ready!</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. What's that wire for, Fabry?</p>

      <p>FABRY. The electrical installation. Now we can run the current all along 

        the garden railing whenever we like. If any one touches it he'll know 

        it. We've still got some people there anyhow.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Where?</p>

      <p>FABRY. In the electrical works. At least I hope so. (<em>Goes to lamp 

        on table behind sofa and turns on lamp.</em>) Ah, they're there, and they're 

        working. (<em>Puts out lamp.</em>) So long as that'll burn we're all right.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. The barricades are all right, too, Fabry.</p>

      <p>FABRY Your barricades! I can put twelve hundred volts into that railing.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Where's Busman?</p>

      <p>FABRY Downstairs in the office. He's working out some calculations. I've 

        called him. We must have a conference.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">[HELENA <em>is heard playing the piano in the library.</em> 

        HALLEMEIER <em>goes to the door and stands, listening.</em>]</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Thank God, Madame Helena can still play.</p>
