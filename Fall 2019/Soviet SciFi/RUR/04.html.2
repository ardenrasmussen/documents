      <p>BUSMAN. In your strongbox, of course.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Someone-- has-- stolen it!</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Impossible.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Who has stolen it?</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>standing up</em>). I did.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Where did you put it?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Harry, I'll tell you everything. Only forgive me.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Where did you put it?</p>

      <p>HELENA. This morning-- I burned-- the two copies.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Burned them? Where? In the fireplace?</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>throwing herself on her knees</em>). For heaven's sake, Harry.</p>

      <p>DOMIN (<em>going to fireplace</em>). Nothing, nothing but ashes. Wait, 

        what's this? (<em>Picks out a charred piece of paper and reads.</em>) 

        "By adding--"</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Let's see. "By adding biogen to--" That's all.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Is that part of it?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Yes.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. God in heaven!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Then we're done for. Get up, Helena.</p>

      <p>HELENA. When you've forgiven me.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Get up, child, I can't bear-- </p>

      <p>FABRY (<em>lifting her up</em>). Please don't torture us.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Harry, what have I done?</p>

      <p>FABRY. Don't tremble so, Madame Helena.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Gall, couldn't you draw up Rossum's formula from memory?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. It's out of the question. It's extremely complicated.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Try. All our lives depend upon it.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Without experiments it's impossible.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. And with experiments?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. It might take years. Besides, I'm not old Rossum.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. God in heaven! God in heaven!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. So, then, this was the greatest triumph of the human intellect. 

        These ashes.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Harry, what have I done?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Why did you burn it?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I have destroyed you.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. God in heaven!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Helena, why did you do it, dear?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I wanted all of us to go away. I wanted to put an end to the 

        factory and everything. It was so awful.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. What was awful?</p>

      <p>HELENA. That no more children were being born. Because human beings were 

        not needed to do the work of the world, that's why-- </p>

      <p>DOMIN. Is that what you were thinking of? Well, perhaps in your own way 

        you were right.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Wait a bit. Good God, what a fool I am, not to have thought of 

        it before!</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. What?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Five hundred and twenty millions in bank notes and checks. Half 

        a billion in our safe, they'll sell for half a billion-- for half a billion 

        they'll-- </p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Are you mad, Busman?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. I may not be a gentleman, but for half a billion-- </p>

      <p>DOMIN. Where are you going?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Leave me alone, leave me alone! Good God, for half a billion 

        anything can be bought. (<em>He rushes from the room through the outer 

        door.</em>)</p>

      <p>FABRY. They stand there as if turned to stone, waiting. As if something 

        dreadful could be wrought by their silence-- </p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. The spirit of the mob.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Yes, it hovers above them like a quivering of the air.</p>

      <p>HELENA. (<em>going to window</em>). Oh, God! Dr. Gall, this is ghastly.</p>

      <p>FABRY. There is nothing more terrible than the mob. The one in front 

        is their leader.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Which one?</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Point him out.</p>

      <p>FABRY. The one at the edge of the dock. This morning I saw him talking 

        to the sailors in the harbor.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Dr. Gall, that's Radius!</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Yes.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Radius? Radius?</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Could you get him from here, Fabry?</p>

      <p>FABRY. I hope so.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Try it, then.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Good. (<em>Draws his revolver and takes aim.</em>)</p>

      <p>HELENA. Fabry, don't shoot him.</p>

      <p>FABRY. He's their leader.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Fire!</p>

      <p>HELENA. Fabry, I beg of you.</p>

      <p>FABRY (<em>lowering the revolver</em>). Very well.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Radius, whose life I spared!</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Do you think that a Robot can be grateful? (<em>Pause.</em>)</p>

      <p>FABRY. Busman's going out to them.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. He's carrying something. Papers. That's money. Bundles of 

        money. What's that for?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Surely he doesn't want to sell his life. Busman, have you gone 

        mad?</p>

      <p>FABRY. He's running up to the railing. Busman! Busman!</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER (<em>yelling</em>). Busman! Come back!</p>

      <p>FABRY. He's talking to the Robots. He's showing them the money.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. He's pointing to us.</p>

      <p>HELENA. He wants to buy us off.</p>

      <p>FABRY. He'd better not touch that railing.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Now he's waving his arms about.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Busman, come back.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Busman, keep away from that railing! Don't touch it. Damn you! 

        Quick, switch off the current! (HELENA <em>screams and all drop back from 

        the window.</em>) The current has killed him!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. The first one.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Dead, with half a billion by his side.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. All honor to him. He wanted to buy us life. (<em>Pause</em>).</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Do you hear?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. A roaring. Like a wind.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Like a distant storm.</p>

      <p>FABRY (<em>lighting the lamp on the table</em>). The dynamo is still 

        going, our people are still there.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. It was a great thing to be a man. There was something immense 

        about it.</p>

      <p>FABRY. From man's thought and man's power came this light, our last hope.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Man's power! May it keep watch over us. </p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Man's power.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Yes! A torch to be given from hand to hand, from age to age, forever! 

        (<em>The lamp goes out.</em>)</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. The end.</p>

      <p>FABRY. The electric works have fallen!</p>

      <p align="CENTER">[<em>Terrific explosion outside.</em> NANA <em>enters 

        from the library.</em>]</p>

      <p>NANA. The judgment hour has come! Repent, unbelievers! This is the end 

        of the world. (<em>More explosions. The sky grows red.</em>)</p>

      <p>DOMIN. In here, Helena. (<em>He takes</em> HELENA <em>off through door 

        at right and reenters.</em>) Now quickly! Who'll be on the lower doorway?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. I will. (<em>Exits left.</em>)</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Who on the stairs?</p>

      <p>FABRY. I will. You go with her. (<em>Goes out upper left door.</em>)</p>

      <p>DOMIN. The anteroom.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I will.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Have you got a revolver?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Yes, but I won't shoot.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. What will you do then?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST (<em>going out at left</em>). Die.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. I'll stay here. (<em>Rapid firing from below.</em>) Oho, 

        Gall's at it. Go, Harry.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Yes, in a second. (<em>Examines two Brownings.</em>)</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Confound it, go to her.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Good-bye. (<em>Exits on the right.</em>)</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER (<em>alone</em>). Now for a barricade quickly. (<em>Drags 

        an armchair and table to the right-hand door. Explosions are heard.</em>) 

        The damned rascals! They've got bombs. I must put up a defense. Even if-- 

        even if-- (<em>Shots are heard off left.</em>) Don't give in, Gall. (<em>As 

        he builds his barricade.</em>) I mustn't give in... without... a struggle...</p>

      <p align="CENTER">[<em>A Robot enters over the balcony through the windows 

        center. He comes into the room and stabs</em> HALLEMEIER <em>in the back.</em> 

        RADIUS <em>enters from balcony followed by an army of Robots who pour 

        into the room from all sides.</em>]</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Finished him?</p>

      <p>A ROBOT. Yes. (<em>Two revolver shots from</em> HELENA'S <em>room. Two 

        Robots enter.</em>)</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Finished them?</p>

      <p>A ROBOT. Yes.</p>

      <p>TWO ROBOTS (<em>dragging in</em> ALQUIST). He didn't shoot. Shall we 

        kill him?</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Kill him? Wait! Leave him!</p>

      <p>ROBOT. He is a man!</p>

      <p>RADIUS. He works with his hands like the Robots.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Kill me.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. You will work! You will build for us! You will serve us! (<em>Climbs 

        onto balcony railing, and speaks in measured tones.</em>) Robots of the 

        world! The power of man has fallen! A new world has arisen: the Rule of 

        the Robots! March!</p>

      <p align="CENTER">[<em>A thunderous tramping of thousands of feet is heard 

        as the unseen Robots march, while the curtain falls.</em>]</p>
