      <p>FABRY. Why did you do it, then?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. For my own satisfaction. The experiment was my own.</p>

      <p>HELENA. That's not true, Dr. Gall!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Helena, you? Let's look at you. Oh, it's terrible to be dead.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Stop, Harry.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. No, no, embrace me. Helena don't leave me now. You are life itself.</p>

      <p>HELENA. No, dear, I won't leave you. But I must tell them. Dr. Gall is 

        not guilty.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Excuse me, Gall was under certain obligations.</p>

      <p>HELENA. No, Harry. He did it because I wanted it. Tell them, Gall, how 

        many years ago did I ask you to--?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. I did it on my own responsibility.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Don't believe him, Harry. I asked him to give the Robots souls.</p>
      <p>DOMIN. This has nothing to do with the soul.</p>

      <p>HELENA. That's what he said. He said that he could change only a physiological-- 

        a physiological-- </p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER A physiological correlate? </p>

      <p>HELENA. Yes. But it meant so much to me that he should do even that.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Why?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I thought that if they were more like us they would understand 

        us better. That they couldn't hate us if they were only a little</p>

      <p>more human.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Nobody can hate man more than man.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, don't speak like that, Harry. It was so terrible, this cruel 

        strangeness between us and them. That's why I asked Gall to change the 

        Robots. I swear to you that he didn't want to.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. But he did it.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Because I asked him.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. I did it for myself as an experiment.</p>

      <p>HELENA. No, Dr. Gall! I knew you wouldn't refuse me.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Why?</p>

      <p>HELENA. You know, Harry.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Yes, because he's in love with you-- like all of them. (<em>Pause.</em>)</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Good God! They're sprouting up out of the earth! Why, perhaps 

        these very walls will change into Robots.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Gall, when did you actually start these tricks of yours?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Three years ago.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Aha! That means for every million of the good old Robots there's 

        only one of Gall's improved pattern.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. What of it?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. That it's practically of no consequence whatever.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Busman's right!</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. I should think so, my boy! But do you know what is to blame for 

        all this lovely mess?</p>

      <p>FABRY. What?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. The number. Upon my soul we might have known that some day or 

        other the Robots would be stronger than human beings, and that this was 

        bound to happen, and we were doing all we could to bring it about as soon 

        as possible. You, Domin, you, Fabry, myself-- </p>

      <p>DOMIN. Are your accusing us?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Oh, do you suppose the management controls the output? It's the 

        demand that controls the output.</p>

      <p>HELENA. And is it for that we must perish?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. That's a nasty word, Madame Helena. We don't want to perish. 

        I don't, anyhow.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. No. What do you want to do?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. I want to get out of this, that's all.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Oh, stop it, Busman.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Seriously, Harry, I think we might try it.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. How?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. By fair means. I do everything by fair means. Give me a free 

        hand and I'll negotiate with the Robots.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. By fair means?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Of course. For instance, I'll say to them: "Worthy and worshipful 

        Robots, you have everything! You have intellect, you have power, you have 

        firearms. But we have just one interesting screed, a dirty old yellow 

        scrap of paper-- </p>

      <p>DOMIN. Rossum's manuscript?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Yes. "And that," I'll tell them, "contains an account of your 

        illustrious origin, the noble process of your manufacture," and so on. 

        "Worthy Robots, without this scribble on that paper you will not be able 

        to produce a single new colleague. In another twenty years there will 

        not be one living specimen of a Robot that you could exhibit in a menagerie. 

        My esteemed friends, that would be a great blow to you, but if you will 

        let all of us human beings on Rossum's Island go on board that ship we 

        will deliver the factory and the secret of the process to you in return. 

        You allow us to get away and we allow you to manufacture yourselves. Worthy 

        Robots, that is a fair deal. Something for something." That's what I'd 

        say to them, my boys.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Busman, do you think we'd sell the manuscript?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Yes, I do. If not in a friendly way, then-- Either we sell it 

        or they'll find it. Just as you like.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Busman, we can destroy Rossum's manuscript.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Then we destroy everything... not only the manuscript but ourselves. 

        Do as you think fit.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. There are over thirty of us on this island. Are we to sell the 

        secret and save that many human souls, at the risk of enslaving mankind?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Why, you're mad! Who'd sell the whole manuscript?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Busman, no cheating!</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Well then, sell; but afterward-- </p>

      <p>DOMIN. Well?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Let's suppose this happens: When we're on board the <em>Ultimus</em> 

        I'll stop up my ears with cotton wool, lie down somewhere in the hold, 

        and you'll train the guns on the factory, and blow it to smithereens, 

        and with it Rossum's secret.</p>

      <p>FABRY. No!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Busman, you're no gentleman. If we sell, then it will be a straight 

        sale.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. It's in the interest of humanity to-- </p>

      <p>DOMIN. It's in the interest of humanity to keep our word.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Oh, come, what rubbish!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. This is a fearful decision. We're selling the destiny of mankind. 

        Are we to sell or destroy? Fabry?</p>

      <p>FABRY. Sell.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Gall?</p>

      <p>DR. GAIL. Sell.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Hallemeier?</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Sell, of course!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Alquist?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. As God wills.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Very well. It shall be as you wish, gentlemen.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Harry, you're not asking me.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. No, child. Don't you worry about it.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Who'll do the negotiating?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. I will.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Wait till I bring the manuscript. (<em>He goes into room at right.</em>)</p>

      <p>HELENA. Harry, don't go! (<em>Pause, </em>HELENA <em>sinks into a chair.</em>)</p>

      <p>FABRY (<em>looking out of window</em>). Oh, to escape you, you matter 

        in revolt; oh, to preserve human life, if only upon a single vessel-- 

      </p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Don't be afraid, Madame Helena. We'll sail far away from here; 

        we'll begin life all over again-- </p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, Gall, don't speak.</p>

      <p>FABRY. It isn't too late. It will be a little State with one ship. Alquist 

        will build us a house and you shall rule over us.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Madame Helena, Fabry's right.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>breaking down</em>). Oh, stop! Stop!</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Good! I don't mind beginning all over again. That suits me right 

        down to the ground.</p>

      <p>FABRY. And this little State of ours could be the center of future life. 

        A place of refuge where we could gather strength. Why, in a few hundred 

        years we could conquer the world again.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. You believe that even today?</p>

      <p>FABRY. Yes, even today!</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Amen. You see, Madame Helena, we're not so badly off. </p>

      <p align="CENTER">[DOMIN <em>storms into the room.</em>]</p>

      <p>DOMIN. (<em>hoarsely</em>). Where's old Rossum's manuscript?</p>
