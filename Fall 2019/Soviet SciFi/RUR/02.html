          <h1><strong>Act One:</strong></h1>

          <h2><strong>CENTRAL OFFICE OF THE FACTORY OF ROSSUM'S UNIVERSAL ROBOTS</strong></h2>

        </div>

        <p align="left"> Central office of the factory of Rossum's Universal Robots. 

          Entrance on the right. The windows on the front wall look out on the 

          rows of factory chimneys. On the left more managing departments. DOMIN 

          is sitting in the revolving chair at a large American writing table. 

          On the left-hand wall large maps showing steamship and railroad routes. 

          On the right-hand wall are fastened printed placards. ("Robot's Cheapest 

          Labor," and so on.) In contrast to these wall fittings, the floor is 

          covered with a splendid Turkish Carpet, a sofa, leather armchair, and 

          filing cabinets. At a desk near the windows SULLA is typing letters.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>dictating</em>). Ready? </p>

        <p align="left">SULLA. Yes.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. To E.M. McVicker and Co., Southampton, England. 

          "We undertake no guarantee for goods damaged in transit. As soon as 

          the consignment was taken on board we drew your captain's attention 

          to the fact that the vessel was unsuitable for the transport of Robots, 

          and we are therefore not responsible for spoiled freight. We beg to 

          remain, for Rossum's Universal Robots. Yours truly." (SULLA, <em>who 

          has sat motionless during dictation, now types rapidly for a few seconds, 

          then stops, withdrawing the completed letter.</em>) Ready?</p>

        <p align="left">SULLA. Yes.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Another letter. To the E. B. Huyson Agency, New 

          York, U.S.A. "We beg to acknowledge receipt of order for five thousand 

          Robots. As you are sending your own vessel, please dispatch as cargo 

          equal quantities of soft and hard coal for R.U.R., the same to be credited 

          as part payment of the amount due to us. We beg to remain, for Rossum's 

          Universal Robots. Yours truly." (SULLA <em>repeats the rapid typing.</em>) 

          Ready?</p>

        <p align="left">SULLA. Yes.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Another letter. "Friedrichswerks, Hamburg, Germany. 

          We beg to acknowledge receipt of order for fifteen thousand Robots." 

          (<em>Telephone rings.</em>) Hello! This is the Central Office. Yes. 

          Certainly. Well, send them a wire. Good. (<em>Hangs up telephone.</em>) 

          Where did I leave off?</p>

        <p align="left">SULLA. "We beg to acknowledge receipt of order for fifteen 

          thousand Robots."</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN: Fifteen thousand R. Fifteen thousand R. <br>

        <div align="left">[<em>Enter</em> MARIUS.]Well, what is it? </div>

        <p align="left"></p>

        <p align="left">MARIUS. There's a lady, sir, asking to see you.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. A lady? Who is she?</p>

        <p align="left">MARIUS. I don't know, sir. She brings this card of introduction.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>reads the card</em>). Ah, from President Glory. 

          Ask her to come in.</p>

        <p align="left">MARIUS. Please step this way. (<em>Exit</em> MARIUS.)</p>

        <p align="left">[<em>Enter</em> HELENA GLORY.]</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. How do you do?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. How do you do. (<em>Standing up.</em>) What can 

          I do for you?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. You are Mr. Domin, the General Manager.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. I am.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I have come-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. With President Glory's card. That is quite sufficient.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. President Glory is my father. I am Helena Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Miss Glory, this is such a great honor for us to 

          be allowed to welcome our great President's daughter, that--</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. That you can't show me the door?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Please sit down. Sulla, you may go. (<em>Exit</em> 

          SULLA.) (<em>Sitting down.</em>) How can I be of service to you, Miss 

          Glory?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I have come-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. To have a look at our famous works where people 

          are manufactured. Like all visitors. Well, there is no objection.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I thought it was forbidden to-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. To enter the factory. Yes, of course. Everybody 

          comes here with someone's visiting card, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. And you show them-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Only certain things. The manufacture of artificial 

          people is a secret process.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. If you only knew how enormously that-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Interests me. Europe's talking about nothing else.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why don't you let me finish speaking?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. I beg your pardon. Did you want to say something 

          different?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I only wanted to ask-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Whether I could make a special exception in your 

          case and</p>

        <p align="left">show you our factory. Why, certainly, Miss Glory. </p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. How do you know I wanted to say that?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. They all do. But we shall consider it a special 

          honor to show you more than we do the rest.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Thank you.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. But you must agree not to divulge the least...</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA (<em>standing up and giving him her hand</em>). 

          My word of honor.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Thank you. Won't you raise your veil?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Of course. You want to see whether I'm a spy or 

          not. I beg your pardon.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. What is it?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Would you mind releasing my hand?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>releasing it</em>). I beg your pardon.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA (<em>raising her veil</em>). How cautious you have 

          to be here, don't you?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>observing her with deep interest</em>). Hm, 

          of course-- we-- that is-- </p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But what is it? What's the matter?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. I'm remarkably pleased. Did you have a pleasant 

          crossing?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Yes.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN No difficulty?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. What I mean to say is-- you're so young.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. May we go straight into the factory?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes. Twenty-two, I think.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Twenty-two what?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Years.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Twenty-one. Why do you want to know?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Because-- as-- (<em>With enthusiasm.</em>) you 

          will make a long stay, won't you?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. That depends on how much of the factory you show 

          me.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Oh, hang the factory. Oh, no, no, you shall see 

          everything, Miss Glory. Indeed you shall. Won't you sit down?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA <em>(crossing to couch and sitting). </em>Thank 

          you.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. But first would you like to hear the story of the 

          invention?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Yes, indeed.</p>
