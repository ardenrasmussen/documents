      <p>HELENA. Among huge trees. All my feelings were so trifling compared with 

        your self-confidence. And in all these years I've never lost this anxiety. 

        But you've never felt the least misgivings-- not even when everything 

        went wrong.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. What went wrong?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Your plans. You remember, Harry, when the workingmen in America 

        revolted against the Robots and smashed them up, and when the people gave 

        the Robots firearms against the rebels. And then when the governments 

        turned the Robots into soldiers, and there were so many wars.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. (<em>getting up and walking about</em>). We foresaw that, Helena. 

        You see, those are only passing troubles, which are bound to happen before 

        the new conditions are established.</p>

      <p>HELENA. You were all so powerful, so overwhelming. The whole world bowed 

        down before you. (<em>Standing up.</em>) Oh, Harry!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. What is it?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Close the factory and let's go away. All of us.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. I say, what's the meaning of this?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I don't know. But can't we go away?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Impossible, Helena. That is, at this particular moment-- </p>

      <p>HELENA. At once, Harry. I'm so frightened.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. About what, Helena?</p>

      <p>HELENA. It's as if something was falling on top of us, and couldn't be 

        stopped. Oh, take us all away from here. We'll find a place in the world 

        where there's no one else. Alquist will build us a house, and then we'll 

        begin life all over again. (<em>The telephone rings.</em>)</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Excuse me. Hello-- yes. What? I'll be there at once. Fabry is 

        calling me, dear.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Tell me-- </p>

      <p>DOMIN. Yes, when I come back. Don't go out of the house, dear. (<em>Exits.</em>)</p>

      <p>HELENA. He won't tell me-- Nana, Nana, come at once.</p>

      <p>NANA. Well, what is it now?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Nana, find me the latest newspapers. Quickly. Look in Mr. Domin's 

        bedroom.</p>

      <p>NANA. All right. He leaves them all over the place. That's how they get 

        crumpled up. (<em>Exits.</em>)</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>looking through a binocular at the harbor</em>). That's a 

        warship. U-l-t-i <em>Ultimus. </em>They're loading it.</p>

      <p>NANA. Here they are. See how they're crumpled up. (<em>Enters.</em>)</p>

      <p>HELENA. They're old ones. A week old. (NANA <em>sits in chair and reads 

        the newspapers.</em>) Something's happening, Nana.</p>

      <p>NANA. Very likely. It always does. (<em>Spelling out the words.</em>) 

        "War in the Balkans." Is that far off?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, don't read it. It's always the same. Always wars. NANA. What 

        else do you expect? Why do you keep selling thousands</p>

      <p>and thousands of these heathens as soldiers?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I suppose it can't be helped, Nana. We can't know-- Domin can't 

        know what they're to be used for. When an order comes for them he must 

        just send them.</p>

      <p>NANA. He shouldn't make them. (<em>Reading from newspaper.</em>) "The 

        Ro-bot soldiers spare no-body in the occ-upied terr-it-ory. They have 

        ass-ass-ass-ass-in-at-ed ov-er sev-en hun-dred thou-sand cit-iz-ens." 

        Citizens, if you please.</p>

      <p>HELENA. It can't be. Let me see. "They have assassinated over seven hundred 

        thousand citizens, evidently at the order of their commander. This act 

        which runs counter to--"</p>

      <p>NANA (<em>spelling out the words</em>). "Re-bell-ion in Ma-drid a-gainst 

        the govern-ment. Rob-ot in-fant-ry fires on the crowd. Nine thou-sand 

        killed and wounded."</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, stop.</p>

      <p>NANA. Here's something printed in big letters: "Latest news. At Havre 

        the first org-an-iz-ation of Rob-ots has been e-stab-lished. Rob-ot work-men, 

        cab-le and rail-way off-ic-ials, sail-ors and sold-iers have iss-ued a 

        man-i-fest-o to all Rob-ots through-out the world." I don't understand 

        that. That's got no sense. Oh, good gracious, another murder!</p>

      <p>HELENA. Take those papers away, Nana!</p>

      <p>NANA. Wait a bit. Here's something in still bigger type. "Stat-ist-ics 

        of pop-ul-at-lon." What's that?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Let me see. (<em>Reads.</em>) "During the past week there has 

        again not been a single birth recorded."</p>

      <p>NANA. What's the meaning of that?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Nana, no more people are being born.</p>

      <p>NANA. That's the end, then. We're done for.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Don't talk like that.</p>

      <p>NANA. No more people are being born. That's a punishment, that's a punishment.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Nana!</p>

      <p>NANA (<em>standing up</em>). That's the end of the world. (<em>She exits 

        on the left.</em>)</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>goes up to window</em>). Oh, Mr. Alquist, will you come up 

        here. Oh, come just as you are. You look very nice in your mason's overalls. 

      <p>[ALQUIST <em>enters from upper left entrance, his hand soiled with lime 

        and brick dust.</em>]</p>

      <p>Dear Mr. Alquist, it was awfully kind of you, that lovely present. </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>ALQUIST. My hands are all soiled. I've been experimenting with that new 

        cement.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Never mind. Please sit down. Mr. Aiquist, what's the meaning 

        of "Ultimus"?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. The last. Why?</p>

      <p>HELENA. That's the name of my new ship. Have you seen it? Do you think 

        we're going off soon-- on a trip?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Perhaps very soon.</p>

      <p>HELENA. All of you with me?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I should like us all to be there.</p>

      <p>HELENA. What is the matter?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Things are just moving on.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Dear Mr. Alquist, I know something dreadful has happened.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Has your husband told you anything?</p>

      <p>HELENA. No. Nobody will tell me anything. But I feel-- Is anything the 

        matter?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Not that we've heard of yet.</p>

      <p>HELENA. I feel so nervous. Don't you ever feel nervous?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Well, I'm an old man, you know. I've got old-fashioned ways. 

        And I'm afraid of all this progress, and these newfangled ideas.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Like Nana?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Yes, like Nana. Has Nana got a prayer book?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Yes, a big thick one.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. And has it got prayers for various occasions? Against thunderstorms? 

        Against illness?</p>

      <p>HELENA. Against temptations, against floods-- </p>

      <p>ALQUIST. But not against progress?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I don't think so.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. That's a pity.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Why? Do you mean you'd like to pray?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I do pray.</p>

      <p>HELENA. How?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Something like this: "Oh, Lord, I thank thee for having given 

        me toil. Enlighten Domin and all those who are astray; destroy their work, 

        and aid mankind to return to their labors; let them not suffer harm in 

        soul or body; deliver us from the Robots, and protect Helena, Amen."</p>

      <p>HELENA. Mr. Alquist, are you a believer?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I don't know. I'm not quite sure.</p>

      <p>HELENA. And yet you pray?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. That's better than worrying about it.</p>

      <p>HELENA. And that's enough for you?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. It <em>has </em>to be.</p>

      <p>HELENA. But if you thought you saw the destruction of mankind coming 

        upon us-- </p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I do see it.</p>

      <p>HELENA. You mean mankind will be destroyed?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. It's sure to be unless-- unless...</p>

      <p>HELENA. What?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Nothing, good-bye. (<em>He hurries from the room.</em>)</p>
