        <h1><strong>Act II</strong></h1>

          <h2><strong>HELENA'S DRAWING ROOM&#151;TEN YEARS LATER. MORNING.</strong></h2>

        </div>

        <p>HELENA'S <em>drawing room. On the left a baize door, and a door to 

          the music room, on the right a door to</em> HELENA'S <em>bedroom. In 

          the center are windows looking out on the sea and the harbor. A table 

          with odds and ends, a sofa and chairs, a writing table with an electric 

          lamp, on the right a fireplace. On a small table back of the sofa, a 

          small reading lamp. The whole drawing room in all its details is of 

          a modern and purely feminine character. Ten years have elapsed since 

          Act I.</em></p>

        <p>[DOMIN, FABRY, HALLEMEIER <em>enter on tiptoe from the left, each carrying 

          a potted plant.</em>]</p>

        <p>HALLEMEIER (<em>putting down his flower and indicating the door to 

          right</em>). Still asleep? Well, as long as she's asleep she can't worry 

          about it.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. She knows nothing about it.</p>

        <p>FABRY (<em>putting plant on writing desk</em>). I certainly hope nothing 

          happens today.</p>

        

      <p>HALLEMEIER. For goodness' sake drop it all. Look, Harry, this is a fine 

        cyclamen, isn't it? A new sort, my latest-- Cyclamen Helena.</p>

        <p>DOMIN (<em>looking out of the window</em>). No signs of the ship. Things 

          must be pretty bad.</p>

        <p>HALLEMEIER. Be quiet. Suppose she heard you.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Well, anyway, the <em>Ultimus </em>arrived just in time.</p>

        <p>FABRY. You really think that today--?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. I don't know. Aren't the flowers fine?</p>

        <p>HALLEMEIER. These are my new primroses. And this is my new jasmine. 

          I've discovered a wonderful way of developing flowers quickly. Splendid 

          varieties, too. Next year I'll be developing marvelous ones.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. What-- next year?</p>

        <p>FABRY. I'd give a good deal to know what's happening at Havre with-- 

        </p>

        <p>DOMIN. Keep quiet.</p>

        <p>HELENA (<em>calling from right</em>). Nana!</p>

        <p>DOMIN. She's awake. Out you go. (<em>All go out on tiptoe through upper 

          left door.</em>)</p>

        <p>[<em>Enter</em> NANA <em>from lower left door.</em>]</p>

        <p>NANA. Horrid mess! Pack of heathens. If I had my say I'd-- </p>

        <p>HELENA (<em>backward in the doorway</em>). Nana, come and do up my 

          dress.</p>

        <p>NANA. I'm coming. So you're up at last. (<em>Fastening</em> HELENA'S 

          <em>dress.</em>) My gracious, what brutes!</p>

        <p>HELENA. Who?</p>

        <p>NANA. If you want to turn around, then turn around, but I shan't fasten 

          you up.</p>

        <p>HELENA. What are you grumbling about now?</p>

        <p>NANA. These dreadful creatures, these heathen-- </p>

        <p>HELENA. The Robots?</p>

        <p>NANA. I wouldn't even call them by name.</p>

        <p>HELENA. What's happened?</p>

        <p>NANA. Another of them here has caught it. He began to smash up the 

          statues and pictures in the drawing room, gnashed his teeth, foamed 

          at the mouth-- quite mad. Worse than an animal.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Which of them caught it?</p>

        <p>NANA. The one-- well, he hasn't got any Christian name. The one in 

          charge of the library.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Radius?</p>

        <p>NANA. That's him. My goodness, I'm scared of them. A spider doesn't 

          scare me as much as them.</p>

        <p>HELENA. But, Nana, I'm surprised you're not sorry for them.</p>

        <p>NANA. Why, you're scared of them, too! You know you are. Why else did 

          you bring me here?</p>

        <p>HELENA. I'm not scared, really I'm not, Nana. I'm only sorry for them. 

        </p>

        <p>NANA. You're scared. Nobody could help being scared. Why, the dog's 

          scared of them: he won't take a scrap of meat out of their hands. He 

          draws in his tail and howls when he knows they're about.</p>

        <p>HELENA. The dog has no sense.</p>

        <p>NANA. He's better than them, and he knows it. Even the horse shies 

          when he meets them. They don't have any young, and a dog has young, 

          everyone has young-- </p>

        <p>HELENA. Please fasten up my dress, Nana.</p>

        <p>NANA. I say it's against God's will to-- </p>

        <p>HELENA. What is it that smells so nice?</p>

        <p>NANA. Flowers.</p>

        <p>HELENA. What for?</p>

        <p>NANA. Now you can turn around.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Oh, aren't they lovely! Look, Nana. What's happening today?</p>

        <p>NANA. It ought to be the end of the world.</p>

        <p>[<em>Enter</em> DOMIN.]</p>

        <p>HELENA. Oh, hello, Harry. Harry, why all these flowers?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Guess.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Well, it's not my birthday!</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Better than that.</p>

        <p>HELENA. I don't know. Tell me.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. It's ten years ago today since you came here.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Ten years? Today-- Why-- (<em>They embrace.</em>)</p>

        <p>NANA. I'm off. (<em>Exits lower door, left.</em>)</p>

        <p>HELENA. Fancy you remembering!</p>

        <p>DOMIN. I'm really ashamed, Helena. I didn't.</p>

        <p>HELENA. But you-- </p>

        <p>DOMIN. They remembered.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Who?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Busman, Hallemeier, all of them. Put your hand in my pocket.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Pearls! A necklace. Harry, is that for me?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. It's from Busman.</p>

        <p>HELENA. But we can't accept it, can we?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Oh, yes, we can. Put your hand in the other pocket.</p>

        <p>HELENA (<em>takes a revolver out of his pocket</em>). What's that?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Sorry. Not that. Try again.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Oh, Harry, what do you carry a revolver for?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. It got there by mistake.</p>

        <p>HELENA. You never used to carry one.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. No, you're right. There, that's the pocket.</p>

        <p>HELENA. A cameo. Why, it's a Greek cameo!</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Apparently. Anyhow, Fabry says it is.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Fabry? Did Mr. Fabry give me this?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Of course. (<em>Opens the door at the left.</em>) And look in 

          here. Helena, come and see this.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Oh, isn't it fine! Is this from you?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. No, from Alquist. And there's another on the piano.</p>

        <p>HELENA. This must be from you.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. There's a card on it.</p>

        <p>HELENA. From Dr. Gall. (<em>Reappearing in the doorway.</em>) Oh, Harry, 

          I feel embarrassed at so much kindness.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Come here. This is what Hallemeier brought you.</p>

        <p>HELENA. These beautiful flowers?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Yes. It's a new kind. Cyclamen Helena. He grew them in honor 

          of you. They are almost as beautiful as you.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Harry, why do they all-- </p>

        <p>DOMIN. They're awfully fond of you. I'm afraid that my present is a 

          little-- Look out of the window.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Where?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Into the harbor.</p>

        <p>HELENA. There's a new ship.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. That's your ship.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Mine? How do you mean?</p>

        <p>DOMIN For you to take trips in-- for your amusement.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Harry, that's a gunboat.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. A gunboat? What are you thinking of? It's only a little bigger 

          and more solid than most ships.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Yes, but with guns.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Oh, yes, with a few guns. You'll travel like a queen, Helena.</p>

        <p>HELENA. What's the meaning of it? Has anything happened?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Good heavens, no. I say, try these pearls.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Harry, have you had bad news?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. On the contrary, no letters have arrived for a whole week.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Nor telegrams?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Nor telegrams.</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Holidays for us. We all sit in the office with our feet on the 

          table and take a nap. No letters, no telegrams. Oh, glorious.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Then you'll stay with me today?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Certainly. That is, we will see. Do you remember ten years ago 

          today? "Miss Glory, it's a great honor to welcome you."</p>

        <p>HELENA. "Oh, Mr. Manager, I'm so interested in your factory."</p>

        <p>DOMIN. "I'm sorry, Miss Glory, it's strictly forbidden. The manufacture 

          of artificial people is a secret."</p>

        <p>HELENA. "But to oblige a young lady who has come a long way."</p>

        <p>DOMIN. "Certainly, Miss Glory, we have no secrets from you."</p>

        <p>HELENA (<em>seriously</em>). Are you sure, Harry?</p>

        <p>DOMIN. Yes.</p>

        <p>HELENA. "But I warn you, sir; this young lady intends to do terrible 

          things."</p>

        <p>DOMIN. "Good gracious, Miss Glory. Perhaps she doesn't want to marry 

          me."</p>

        <p>HELENA. "Heaven forbid. She never dreamed of such a thing. But she 

          came here intending to stir up a revolt among your Robots."</p>

        <p>DOMIN (<em>suddenly serious</em>). A revolt of the Robots!</p>

        <p>HELENA. Harry, what's the matter with you?</p>

        <p>DOMIN (<em>laughing it off</em>). "A revolt of the Robots, that's a 

          fine idea, Miss Glory. It would be easier for you to cause bolts and 

          screws to rebel, than our Robots. You know, Helena, you're wonderful, 

          you've turned the heads of us all." (<em>He sits on the arm of</em> 

          HELENA's <em>chair.</em>)</p>

        <p>HELENA (<em>naturally</em>). Oh, I was fearfully impressed by you all 

          then. You were all so sure of yourselves, so strong. I seemed like a 

          tiny little girl who had lost her way among-- among-- </p>

        <p>DOMIN. Among what, Helena?</p>
