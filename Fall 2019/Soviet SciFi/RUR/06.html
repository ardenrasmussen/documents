        <p align="left">FABRY. Pardon me. But kindly tell me what is the real 

          aim of your League-- the-- the Humanity League.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Its real purpose is to-- to protect the Robots-- 

          and-- and ensure good treatment for them.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. Not a bad object, either. A machine has to be treated 

          properly. Upon my soul, I approve of that. I don't like damaged articles. 

          Please, Miss Glory, enroll us all as contributing, or regular, or foundation 

          members of your League.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. No, you don't understand me. What we really want 

          is to-- to liberate the Robots.</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. How do you propose to do that? </p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. They are to be--to be dealt with like human beings.</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. Aha. I suppose they're to vote? To drink beer? 

          To order us about?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why shouldn't they drink beer?</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER Perhaps they're even to receive wages?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Of course they are.</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER Fancy that, now! And what would they do with 

          their wages, pray?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. They would buy-- what they need.. what pleases 

          them. </p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. That would be very nice, Miss Glory, only 

          there's nothing that does please the Robots. Good heavens, what are 

          they to buy? You can feed them on pineapples, straw, whatever you like. 

          It's all the same to them; they've no appetite at all. They've no interest 

          in anything, Miss Glory. Why, hang it all, nobody's ever yet seen a 

          Robot smile.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why... why don't you make them happier?</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. That wouldn't do, Miss Glory. They are only 

          workmen.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, but they're so intelligent.</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. Confoundedly so, but they're nothing else. 

          They've no will of their own. No passion. No soul.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. No love?</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. Love? Rather not. Robots don't love. Not even 

          themselves.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA Nor defiance?</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. Defiance? I don't know. Only rarely, from 

          time to time.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What?</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. Nothing particular. Occasionally they seem 

          to go off their heads. Something like epilepsy, you know. It's called 

          Robot's cramp. They'll suddenly sling down everything they're holding, 

          stand still, gnash their teeth-- and then they have to go to the stamping 

          mill. It's evidently some breakdown in the mechanism.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. A flaw in the works that has to be removed.</p>

        <p align="left">SELENA. No, no, that's the soul.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. Do you think that the soul first shows itself by 

          a gnashing of teeth?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Perhaps it's a sort of revolt. Perhaps it's just 

          a sign that there's a struggle within. Oh, if you could infuse them 

          with it!</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. That'll be remedied, Miss Glory. Dr. Gall is just 

          making some experiments-- </p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Not with regard to that, Domin. At present I 

          am making pain nerves.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Pain nerves?</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Yes, the Robots feel practically no bodily pain. 

          You see, young Rossum provided them with too limited a nervous system. 

          We must introduce suffering.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why do you want to cause them pain?</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. For industrial reasons, Miss Glory. Sometimes 

          a Robot does damage to himself because it doesn't hurt him. He puts 

          his hand into the machine, breaks his finger, smashes his head, it's 

          all the same to him. We must provide them with pain. That's an automatic 

          protection against damage.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Will they be happier when they feel pain?</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. On the contrary; but they will be more perfect 

          from a technical point of view.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why don't you create a soul for them?</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. That's not in our power.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. That's not in our interest.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. That would increase the cost of production. Hang 

          it all, my dear young lady, we turn them out at such a cheap rate. A 

          hundred and fifty dollars each fully dressed, and fifteen years ago 

          they cost ten thousand. Five years ago we used to buy the clothes for 

          them. Today we have our own weaving mill, and now we even export cloth 

          five times cheaper than other factories. What do you pay a yard for 

          cloth, Miss Glory?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I don't know really; I've forgotten.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Good gracious, and you want to found a Humanity 

          League? It only costs a third now, Miss Glory. All prices are today 

          a third of what they were and they'll fall still lower, lower, like 

          that.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I don't understand.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Why, bless you, Miss Glory, it means that the 

          cost of labor has fallen. A Robot, food and all, costs three-quarters 

          of a cent per hour. That's mighty important, you know. All factories 

          will go pop like chestnuts if they don't at once buy Robots to lower 

          the cost of production.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. And get rid of their workmen?</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Of course. But in the meantime, we've dumped five 

          hundred thousand tropical Robots down on the Argentine pampas to grow 

          corn. Would you mind telling me how much you pay a pound for bread?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I've no idea.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Well, I'll tell you. It now costs two cents in 

          good old Europe. A pound of bread for two cents, and the Humanity League 

          knows nothing about it. Miss Glory, you don't realize that even that's 

          too expensive. Why, in five years' time I'll wager-- </p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What?</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN That the cost of everything won't be a tenth of 

          what it is now. Why, in five years we'll be up to our ears in corn and 

          everything else.</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Yes, and all the workers throughout the world 

          will be unemployed.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes, Aiquist, they will. Yes, Miss Glory, they 

          will. But in ten years Rossum's Universal Robots will produce so much 

          corn, so much cloth, so much everything, that things will be practically 

          without price. There will be no poverty. All work will be done by living 

          machines. Everybody will be free from worry and liberated from the degradation 

          of labor. Everybody will live only to perfect himself.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Will he?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Of course. It's bound to happen. But then the servitude 

          of man to man and the enslavement of man to matter will cease. Of course, 

          terrible things may happen at first, but that simply can't be avoided. 

          Nobody will get bread at the price of life and hatred. The Robots will 

          wash the feet of the beggar and prepare a bed for him in his house.</p>

        <p align="left">ALQUIST. Domin, Domin. What you say sounds too much like 

          Paradise. There was something good in service and something great in 

          humility. There was some kind of virtue in toil and weariness.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Perhaps. But we cannot reckon with what is lost 

          when we start out to transform the world. Man shall be free and supreme; 

          he shall have no other aim, no other labor, no other care than to perfect 

          himself. He shall serve neither matter nor man. He will not be a machine 

          and a device for production. He will be Lord of creation.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Amen.</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. So be it.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. You have bewildered me-- I should like-- I should 

          like to believe this.</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. You are younger than we are, Miss Glory. You 

          will live to see it.</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. True. Don't you think Miss Glory might lunch 

          with us? </p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Of course. Domin, ask on behalf of us all.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Miss Glory, will you do us the honor?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. When you know why I've come-- </p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. For the League of Humanity, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, in that case, perhaps--</p>

        <p align="left">FABRY. That's fine! Miss Glory, excuse me for five minutes.</p>

        <p align="left">DR. GALL. Pardon me, too, dear Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. I won't be long.</p>

        <p align="left">HALLEMEIER. We're all very glad you've come.</p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. We'll be back in exactly five minutes. (<em>All 

          rush out except</em> DOMIN <em>and</em> HELENA.)</p>
