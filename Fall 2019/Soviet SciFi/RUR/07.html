        <p align="left">HELENA. What have they all gone off for?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. To cook, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. To cook what?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN Lunch. The Robots do our cooking for us and as they've 

          no taste it's not altogether-- Hallemeier is awfully good at grills, 

          and Gall can make a kind of sauce, and Busman knows all about omelets.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What a feast! And what's the specialty of Mr.--your 

          builder? </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Alquist? Nothing. He only lays the table. And Fabry 

          will get together a little fruit. Our cuisine is very modest, Miss Glory.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I wanted to ask you something-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. And I wanted to ask you something, too. (<em>Looking 

          at watch.</em>) Five minutes</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What did you want to ask me?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Excuse me, you ask first.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Perhaps it's silly of me, but why do you manufacture 

          female Robots when-- when-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. When sex means nothing to them?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Yes.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. There's a certain demand for them, you see. Servants, 

          saleswomen, stenographers. People are used to it.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But-- but, tell me, are the Robots male and female 

          mutually-- completely without-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Completely indifferent to each other, Miss Glory. 

          There's no sign of any affection between them.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Oh, that's terrible.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Why?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. It's so unnatural. One doesn't know whether to 

          be disgusted or to hate them, or perhaps-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. To pity them?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. That's more like it. What did you want to ask 

          me about?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. I should like to ask you, Miss Helena, whether 

          you will marry me?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. What?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Will you be my wife?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. No! The idea!</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>looking at his watch</em>). Another three minutes. 

          If you won't marry me you'll have to marry one of the other five.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But why should I?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Because they're all going to ask you in turn.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. How could they dare to do such a thing?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. I'm very sorry, Miss Glory. It seems they've all 

          fallen in love with you.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Please don't let them. I'll-- I'll go away at 

          once.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Helena, you wouldn't be so cruel as to refuse us.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But, but-- I can't marry all six.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. No, but one anyhow. If you don't want me, marry 

          Fabry.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I won't.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Dr. Gall.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I don't want any of you.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>again looking at his watch</em>). Another two 

          minutes.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. I think you'd marry any woman who came here.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Plenty of them have come, Helena.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Young?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Yes.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Why didn't you marry one of them?</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Because I didn't lose my head. Until today. Then, 

          as soon as you lifted your veil-- (HELENA <em>turns her head away</em>.) 

          Another minute.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But I don't want you, I tell you.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>laying both hands on her shoulders</em>). One 

          more minute! Now you either have to look me straight in the eye and 

          say "No," violently, and then I'll leave you alone-- or-- (HELENA <em>looks 

          at him.</em>)</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA (<em>turning away</em>). You're mad!</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. A man has to be a bit mad, Helena. That's the best 

          thing about him.</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. You are-- you are-- </p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. Well?</p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. Don't, you're hurting me.</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN. The last chance, Helena. Now, or never-- </p>

        <p align="left">HELENA. But-- but, Harry-- (<em>He embraces and kisses 

          her. Knocking at the door.</em>)</p>

        <p align="left">DOMIN (<em>releasing her</em>). Come in. 

        <p>[<em>Enter</em> BUSMAN, DR. GALL, <em>and</em> HALLEMEIER <em>in kitchen 

          aprons.</em> FABRY <em>with a bouquet and</em> ALQUIST <em>with a napkin

        <p align="left">Have you finished your job? 

        <p align="left"></p>

        <p align="left">BUSMAN. Yes.</p>
