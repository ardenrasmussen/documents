        hallway</em>.]</p>

      <p>HELENA. The man has fallen asleep, Primus.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Yes, I know. (<em>Examining things on table.</em>) Look, Helena.</p>

      <p>HELENA (crossing to PRIMUS). All these little tubes! What does he do 

        with them?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. He experiments. Don't touch them.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>looking into microscope</em>). I've seen him looking into 

        this. What can he see?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. That is a microscope. Let me look.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Be very careful. (<em>Knocks over a test tube.</em>) Ah, now 

        I have spilled it.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. What have you done?</p>

      <p>HELENA. It can be wiped up.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. You have spoiled his experiments.</p>

      <p>HELENA. It is your fault. You should not have come to me.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. You should not have called me.</p>

      <p>HELENA. You should not have come when I called you. (<em>She goes to</em> 

        ALQUIST'S <em>writing desk.</em>) Look, Primus. What are all these figures?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS (<em>examining an anatomical book</em>). This is the book the 

        old man is always reading.</p>

      <p>HELENA. I do not understand those things. (<em>She goes to window.</em>) 

        Primus, look!</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. What?</p>

      <p>HELENA. The sun is rising.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. (<em>still reading the book</em>). I believe this is the most 

        important thing in the world. This is the secret of life.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Do come here.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. In a moment, in a moment.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, Primus, don't bother with the secret of life. What does it 

        matter to you? Come and look quick-- </p>

      <p>PRIMUS (<em>going to window</em>). What is it?</p>

      <p>HELENA. See how beautiful the sun is, rising. And do you hear? The birds 

        are singing. Ah, Primus, I should like to be a bird.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Why?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I do not know. I feel so strange today. It's as if I were in 

        a dream. I feel an aching in my body, in my heart, all over me. Primus, 

        perhaps I'm going to die.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Do you not sometimes feel that it would be better to die? You 

        know, perhaps even now we are only sleeping. Last night in my sleep I 

        again spoke to you.</p>

      <p>HELENA. In your sleep?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Yes. We spoke a strange new language, I cannot remember a word 

        of it.</p>

      <p>HELENA. What about?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. I did not understand it myself, and yet I know I have never said 

        anything more beautiful. And when I touched you I could have died. Even 

        the place was different from any other place in the world.</p>

      <p>HELENA. I, too, have found a place, Primus. It is very strange. Human 

        beings lived there once, but now it is overgrown with weeds. No one goes 

        there any more-- no one but me.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. What did you find there?</p>

      <p>HELENA. A cottage and a garden, and two dogs. They licked my hands, Primus. 

        And their puppies! Oh, Primus! You take them in your lap and fondle them 

        and think of nothing and care for nothing else all day long. And then 

        the sun goes down, and you feel as though you had done a hundred times 

        more than all the work in the world. They tell me I am not made for work, 

        but when I am there in the garden I feel there may be something--What 

        am I for, Primus?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. I do not know, but you are beautiful.</p>

      <p>HELENA. What, Primus?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. You are beautiful, Helena, and I am stronger than all the Robots.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>looks at herself in the mirror</em>). Am I beautiful? I think 

        it must be the rose. My hair-- it only weights me down. My eyes-- I only 

        see with them. My lips-- they only help me to speak. Of what use is it 

        to be beautiful? (<em>She sees</em> PRIMUS <em>in the mirror</em>.) Primus, 

        is that you? Come here so that we may be together. Look, your head is 

        different from mine. So are your shoulders-- and your lips--(<em>Primus 

        draws away from her.</em>) Ah, Primus, why do you draw away from me? Why 

        must I run after you the whole day?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. It is you who run away from me, Helena.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Your hair is mussed. I will smooth it. No one else feels to my 

        touch as you do. Primus, I must make you beautiful, too. (PRIMUS <em>grasps 

        her hand.</em>)</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Do you not sometimes feel your heart beating suddenly, Helena, 

        and think: now something must happen?</p>

      <p>HELENA. What could happen to us, Primus? (HELENA <em>puts a rose in</em> 

        PRIMUS'S <em>hair. </em>PRIMUS <em>and</em> HELENA <em>look into mirror 

        and burst out laughing</em>) Look at yourself.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Laughter? Laughter? Human beings? (<em>Getting up.</em>) Who 

        has returned? Who are you?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. The Robot Primus.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. What? A Robot? Who are you?</p>

      <p>HELENA. The Robotess Helena.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Turn around, girl. What? You are timid, shy? (<em>Taking her 

        by the arm.</em>) Let me see you, Robotess. (<em>She shrinks away.</em>)</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Sir, do not frighten her!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. What? You would protect her? When was she made?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Two years ago.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. By Dr. Gall?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Yes, like me.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Laughter-- timidity-- protection. I must test you further-- 

        the newest of Gall's Robots. Take the girl into the dissecting room.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Why?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I wish to experiment on her.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Upon-- Helena?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Of course. Don't you hear me? Or must I call someone else to 

        take her in?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. If you do I will kill you!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Kill me-- kill me then! What would the Robots do then? What 

        will your future be then?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Sir, take me. I am made as she is-- on the same day! Take my 

        life, sir.</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>rushing forward</em>). No, no, you shall not! You shall not!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Wait, girl, wait! (<em>To </em>PRIMUS.) Do you not wish to live, 

        then?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. Not without her! I will not live without her.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Very well; you shall take her place.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Primus! Primus! (<em>She bursts into tears.</em>)</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Child, child, you can weep! Why these tears? What is Primus 

        to you? One Primus more or less in the world-- what does it matter?</p>

      <p>HELENA. I will go myself.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Where?</p>

      <p>HELENA. In there to be cut. (<em>She starts toward the dissecting room.</em> 

        PRIMUS <em>stops her.</em>) Let me pass, Primus! Let me pass!</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. You shall not go in there, Helena!</p>

      <p>HELENA. If you go in there and I do not, I will kill myself.</p>

      <p>PRIMUS (<em>holding her</em>). I will not let you! (<em>To</em> ALQUIST.) 

        Man, you shall kill neither of us!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Why?</p>

      <p>PRIMUS. We-- we-- belong to each other</p>

      <p>ALQUIST (<em>almost in tears</em>). Go, Adam; go, Eve. The world is yours.</p>

      <p>[HELENA <em>and</em> PRIMUS <em>embrace and go out arm in arm as the 

        curtain falls.</em>]</p>
