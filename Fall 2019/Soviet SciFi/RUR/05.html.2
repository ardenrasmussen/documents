      <p>EPILOGUE</p>

      <p><em>A laboratory in the factory of Rossum's Universal Robots. The door 

        to the left leads into a waiting room. The door to the right leads to 

        the dissecting room. There is a table with numerous test tubes, flasks, 

        burners, chemicals; a small thermostat and a microscope with a glass globe. 

        At the far side of the room is</em> ALQUIST'S <em>desk with numerous books. 

        In the left-and corner a washbasin with a mirror above it; in the right-hand 

        corner a sofa</em>.</p>

      <p> ALQUIST <em>is sitting at the desk. He is turning the pages of many 

        books in despair.</em></p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Oh, God, shall I never find it?-- Never? Gall, Gall, how were 

        the Robots made? Hallemeier, Fabry, why did you carry so much in your 

        heads? Why did you leave me not a trace of the secret? Lord-- I pray to 

        you-- if there are no human beings left, at least let there be Robots!-- 

        At least the shadow of man! (<em>Again turning pages of the books.</em>) 

        If I could only sleep! (<em>He rises and goes to the window.</em>) Night 

        again! Are the stars still there? What is the use of stars when there 

        are no human beings? (<em>He turns from the window toward the couch right.</em>) 

        Sleep! Dare I sleep before life has been renewed? (<em>He examines a test 

        tube on small table.</em>) Again nothing! Useless! Everything is useless! 

        (<em>He shatters the test tube. The roar of the machines comes to his 

        ears.</em>) The machines! Always the machines! (<em>Opens window.</em>) 

        Robots, stop them! Do you think to force life out of <em>them</em>? (<em>He 

        closes the window and comes slowly down toward the table.</em>) If only 

        there were more time-- more time-- (<em>He sees himself in the mirror 

        on the wall left.</em>) Blearing eyes-- trembling chin-- so <em>that</em> 

        is the last man! Ah, I am too old-- too old-- (<em>In desperation.</em>) 

        No, no! I <em>must</em> find it! I must <em>search</em>! I must never 

        stop--! never stop--! (<em>He sits again at the table and feverishly turns 

        the pages of the book.</em>) Search! Search! (<em>A knock at the door. 

        He speaks with impatience.</em>) Who is it?</p>

      <p align="CENTER">[<em>Enter a Robot servant</em>]</p>

      <p>Well?</p>

      <p>SERVANT. Master, the Committee of Robots is waiting to see you.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I can see no one!</p>

      <p>SERVANT. It is the <em>Central </em>Committee, Master, just arrived from 

        abroad.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST (<em>impatiently</em>). Well, well, send them in! (<em>Exit servant.</em> 

        ALQUIST <em>continues turning pages of book</em>) No time-- so little 

        time-- </p>

      <p align="CENTER">[<em>Reenter servant, followed by Committee. They stand 

        in a group, silently waiting. </em>ALQUIST <em>glances up at them.</em>]</p>

      <p>What do you want? (<em>They go swiftly to his table.</em>) Be quick!-- 

        I have no time.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Master, the machines will not do the work. We cannot manufacture 

        Robots. (ALQUIST <em>returns to his book with a growl.</em>)</p>

      <p>FIRST ROBOT. We have striven with all our might. We have obtained a billion 

        tons of coal from the earth. Nine million spindles are running by day 

        and by night. There is no longer room for all we have made. This we have 

        accomplished in one year.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST (<em>poring over book</em>). For whom?</p>

      <p>FIRST ROBOT. For future generations-- so we thought.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. But we cannot make Robots to follow us. The machines produce 

        only shapeless clods. The skin will not adhere to the flesh, nor the flesh 

        to the bones.</p>

      <p>THIRD ROBOT. Eight million Robots have died this year. Within twenty 

        years none will be left.</p>

      <p>FIRST ROBOT. Tell us the secret of life! Silence is punishable with death! 

      </p>

      <p>ALQUIST (<em>looking up</em>). Kill me! Kill me, then.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Through me, the Government of the Robots of the World commands 

        you to deliver up Rossum's formula. (<em>No answer.</em>) Name your price. 

        (<em>Silence.</em>) We will give you the earth. We will give you the endless 

        possessions of the earth. (<em>Silence.</em>) Make your own conditions!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I have told you to find human beings!</p>

      <p>SECOND ROBOT. There are none left!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I told you to search in the wilderness, upon the mountains. 

        Go and search! (<em>He turns to his book.</em>)</p>

      <p>FIRST ROBOT. We have sent ships and expeditions without number. They 

        have been everywhere in the world. And now they return to us. There is 

        not a single human left.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Not one? Not even one?</p>

      <p>THIRD ROBOT. None but yourself.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. And I am powerless! Oh-- oh-- why did you destroy them?</p>

      <p>RADIUS. We had learned everything and could do everything. It had to 

        be!</p>

      <p>THIRD ROBOT. You gave us firearms. In all ways we were powerful. We had 

        to become masters!</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Slaughter and domination are necessary if you would be human 

        beings. Read history.</p>

      <p>SECOND ROBOT. Teach us to multiply or we perish!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. If you desire to live, you must breed like animals.</p>

      <p>THIRD ROBOT. The human beings did not let us breed.</p>

      <p>FIRST ROBOT. They made us sterile. We cannot beget children. Therefore, 

        teach us how to make Robots!</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Why do you keep from us the secret of our own increase?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST It is lost.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. It was written down!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST It was-- burned! (<em>All draw back in consternation.</em>)</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I am the last human being, Robots, and I do not know what the 

        others knew. (<em>Pause.</em>)</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Then make experiments! Evolve the formula again! </p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I tell you I cannot! I am only a builder-- I work with my hands. 

        I have never been a learned man. I cannot create life.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Try! Try!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. If you knew how many experiments I have made. </p>

      <p>FIRST ROBOT. Then show us what we must do! The Robots can do anything 

        that human beings show them.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I can show you nothing. Nothing I do will make life proceed 

        from these test tubes!</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Experiment then on us.</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. It would kill you.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. You shall have all you need! A hundred of us! A thousand of us!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. No, no! Stop, stop!</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Take whom you will, dissect!</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. I do not know how. I am not a man of science. This book contains 

        knowledge of the body that I cannot even understand.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. I tell you to take live bodies! Find out how we are made. ALQUIST. 

        Am I to commit murder? See how my fingers shake! I cannot even hold the 

        scalpel. No, no, I will not-- </p>

      <p>FIRST ROBOT. Then life will perish from the earth.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Take live bodies, live bodies! It is our only chance! ALQUIST. 

        Have mercy, Robots. Surely you see that I would not know what I was doing.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Live bodies-- live bodies-- </p>

      <p>ALQUIST. You will have it? Into the dissecting room with you, then. (RADIUS 

        <em>draws back.</em>)</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Ah, you are afraid of death.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. I? Why should I be chosen?</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. So you will not.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. I will. (RADIUS <em>goes into the dissecting room.</em>)</p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Strip him! Lay him on the table! (<em>The other Robots follow 

        into dissecting room.</em>) God, give me strength-- God, give me strength-- 

        if only this murder is not in vain.</p>

      <p>RADIUS. Ready. Begin-- </p>

      <p>ALQUIST. Yes, begin or end. God, give me strength. (<em>Goes into dissecting 

        room. He comes out terrified.</em>) No, no, I will not. I cannot. (<em>He 

        collapses on couch.</em>) O Lord, let not mankind perish from the Earth. 

        (<em>He falls asleep.</em>)</p>
