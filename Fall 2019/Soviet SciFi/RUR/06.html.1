      <p>DR. GALL. Well, Fabry?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. What's happened? Have you been down to the boat?</p>

      <p>FABRY. Read that, Domin! (FABRY <em>hands</em> DOMIN <em>a small handbill.</em>)</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Let's hear!</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. Tell us, Fabry.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Well, everything is all right-- comparatively. On the whole, much 

        as we expected.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. They acquitted themselves splendidly.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Who?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. The people.</p>

      <p>FABRY. Oh, yes, of course. That is-- excuse me, there is something we 

        ought to discuss alone.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Oh, Fabry, have you had bad news? (DOMIN<em> makes a sign to</em> 

        FABRY.)</p>

      <p>FABRY. No, no on the contrary. I only think that we had better go into 

        the office.</p>

      <p>HELENA. Stay here. I'll go. (<em>She goes into the library.</em>)</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. What's happened?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Damnation!</p>

      <p>FABRY. Bear in mind that the <em>Amelia </em>brought whole bales of these 

        leaflets. No other cargo at all.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. What? But it arrived on the minute.</p>

      <p>FABRY. The Robots are great on punctuality. Read it, Domin.</p>

      <p>DOMIN (<em>reads handbill</em>). "Robots throughout the world: We, the 

        first international organization of Rossum's Universal Robots, proclaim 

        man as our enemy, and an outlaw in the universe." Good heavens, who taught 

        them these phrases?</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Go on.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. They say they are more highly developed than man, stronger and 

        more intelligent. That man's their parasite. Why, it's absurd!</p>

      <p>FABRY. Read the third paragraph.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. "Robots throughout the world, we command you to kill all mankind. 

        Spare no men. Spare no women. Save factories, railways, machinery, mines, 

        and raw materials. Destroy the rest. Then return to work. Work must not 

        be stopped."</p>

      <p>DR GALL. That's ghastly!</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. The devil!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. "These orders are to be carried out as soon as received." Then 

        come detailed instructions. Is this actually being done, Fabry?</p>

      <p>FABRY. Evidently.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">[BUSMAN <em>rushes in.</em>]</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Well, boys, I suppose you've heard the glad news.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Quick-- on board the <em>Ultimus</em>.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Wait, Harry, wait. There's no hurry. My word, that was a sprint!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Why wait?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Because it's no good, my boy. The Robots are already on board 

        the <em>Ultimus</em>.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. That's ugly.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Fabry, telephone the electrical works.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Fabry, my boy, don't. The wire has been cut.</p>

      <p>DOMIN (<em>inspecting his revolver</em>). Well, then, I'll go.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Where?</p>

      <p>DOMIN. To the electrical works. There are some people still there. I'll 

        bring them across.</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Better not try it.</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Why?</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Because I'm very much afraid we are surrounded.</p>

      <p>DR. GALL. Surrounded? (<em>Runs to window.</em>) I rather think you're 

        right.</p>

      <p>HALLEMEIER. By Jove, that's deuced quick work. </p>

      <p align="CENTER">[HELENA <em>runs in from the library.</em>]</p>

      <p>HELENA. Harry, what's this? </p>

      <p>DOMIN. Where did you get it?</p>

      <p>HELENA (<em>points to the manifesto of the Robots, which she has in her 

        hand</em>). The Robots in the kitchen!</p>

      <p>DOMIN. Where are the ones that brought it?</p>

      <p>HELENA. They're gathered round the house. (<em>The factory whistle blows.</em>)</p>

      <p>BUSMAN. Noon?</p>

      <p>DOMIN (<em>looking at his watch</em>). That's not noon yet. That must 

        be-- that's-- </p>

      <p>HELENA. What? </p>

      <p>DOMIN. The Robots' signal! The attack! </p>

      <p>[GALL, HALLEMEIER, <em>and</em> FABRY <em>close and fasten the iron shutters 

        outside the windows, darkening the room. The whistle is still blowing 

        as the curtain falls.</em>]</p>
