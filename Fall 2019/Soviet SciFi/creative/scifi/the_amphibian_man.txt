The story begins with the appearance of a strange and mysterious creature
near the Rocky Cape.
It looked like a human with fish scales
and huge toad-like eyes.
The fishermen called it the Sea Devil.
One day the Sea Devil's footprints
were found on the beach.
The locals swore they saw him riding a dolphin while blowing a horn.
The newspapers reported that it was him who sank the boat Lucia,
kidnapped two young nuns and swallowed a pearl-diver in one gulp.
Don Pedro! Don Pedro!
New tricks of the sea devil!
Children's fairytales!
Trust me, there is no smoke without a fire.
Nonsense.
Devil! The devil!
The devil! The sea devil!
What's the matter, you lazybones?
Why did you stop working?
Damn you! Get back!
The devil! The devil!
- Whom did you see? - The Sea Devil, master!
- Did you see him? - I swear!
Then go get acquainted with him!
Let him cool down. He's delirious.
Listen, Balthazar! How much do I owe you?
You must be kidding. It's me who owes you lots of money.
Then why is your daughter acting like a princess?
I couldn't dream of a better fianc for Guttiere than you.
That's why I persuaded her to stay a bit on your schooner.
So that you'd be able to court her! -- Court her!
I've done nothing else lately!
You seem to ignore me.
Not at all, I did see you push poor Christo overboard.
Listen. It's true that I'm often rough with others. But with you...
I love you.
I will give you everything, my name and my fortune.
You don't give anything for free.
That's how you pay me for my love.
Must I pay already? --Guttierre!
Stop acting so innocent!
Sure!
She's got a strong personality!
Father! Send my things ashore!
Shame on you!
Come back now!
You better go get her.
A shark!
Guttiere!
Help! Help! Don't you see the shark?
But the Sea Devil is there!
Swine!
Put her here. My darling!
It's a miracle. I saw the shark with my own eyes.
- All of us saw it. - I saw it too.
I've split its belly open from jaws to tail.
Stop it.
I understand, father.
but I don't love him. There's nothing I can do about it.
Guttiere. What will become of us?
You know how many debts we have.
Think...of my old age.
Yes, come in.
So, how is our dear guest?
Fine, thank you, Don Pedro.
She wants to tell you something important.
Really?
You tell him, father.
Don't worry.
You can make a public announcement.
She has agreed.
To Guttierre. To you.
To our family!
Don't worry, your daughter won't be sorry. I'm far from being poor.
But soon...I'll be fantastically rich.
You know, I got an idea.
I'll get rid of all those bums
and employ only one diver.
Guess whom!
The Sea Devil!
An hour ago you didn't believe he exists!
I still don't believe in any devils.
It simply is some clever creature that lives under water.
I saw him as near as you are now.
Where?
Where? It doesn not matter. I saw it.
Miss! Are you all right?
I was worried about you.
The Devil!
The Sea Devil is out there! The Devil!
Down there, on the anchor!
Throw the net! Hurry!
Master! We will not hunt the Sea Devil.
Move it! Now!
Go!
You might have imagined it?
No, I haven't, father! He talked to me.
Faster! Faster! Lazy bums! Move it!
I'll get him! Whatever it costs!
Do you want to be my companion?
- But I got no money... - Never mind that!
I'll lend you. You're my future father in law.
Once we've got this creature, we'll settle accounts.
This place is still behind seven locks.
Come in, Mr. Olsen.
Please wait here.
Ah, Olsen! It's been a long time!
But it is not easy to getting in.
It is not to keep you away that I lock my doors.
Why don't you just get rid off those locks and doors? Don't bury yourself alive!
I have my reasons to be afraid of people.
Twenty years ago a group of ignorant fools destroyed my laboratory
They even tried to shoot me.
They don't represent the entire human race.
You still treat patients, don't you?
I'm a scientist. That's my duty.
Dear friend, I came for two reasons.
First, what can Dr. Salvatore tell our newspaper
about the Sea Devil?
Devils don't exist. Neither in the sea nor on land.
That's all you can print as my words.
Could it be some creature yet unknown to science?
My dear friend, you must be hungry. Will you join me for breakfast?
He's been seen here several times. Dive in once more, Balthazar.
- Drop the anchor. - Yes!
You look like a pirate!
With such knives my forefathers
cut throats of those who offended them.
- Well, what? - I saw...
- Him? - No. His burrow.
It leads somewhere over there.
- Who lives up there? - God.
Stop joking.
I'm not joking. He must be a god.
He makes lame people walk, he gives blind people their sight.
We've got a devil in the bay and a god above it...Nuts.
The greatest Dr. Salvatore lives there.
Then it is useless to search there.
But that burrow, we should get serious about it.
A few days ago the prosecutor read my satire
and our newspaper was fined again.
We don't have any money -- our newspaper is for poor people.
Can you lend us ten thousand?
Or it will be closed.
My dear Olsen! To you personally I'd give anything you need.
But I won't give anything to your newspaper.
Thank you, but personally, I don't need a thing.
With me it's a matter of principle, not to get involved in politics.
So let everything stay the way it is?
Not at all! The unfortunate should be helped.
But a politician or a journalist cannot help them. A scientist can.
- Really? - Yes.
- And that means you? - Exactly!
I will lead the poor to the land of abundance
where nobody will oppress them.
Where? To heaven? To the moon?
No.
To the ocean! To the ocean.
At the bottom of the ocean, there're neither poor nor rich.
Everyone will be free and happy there.
The republic of the drowned?
Don't laugh, Olsen. I am revealing you the greatest secret.
Can you imagine the ocean
where people breathe under water like fish?
Dear friend, it sounds like a fairy tale.
No, it's not a fairy tale.
Follow me!
lchthyander!
The Sea Devil!
No photos. This is my son, Ichthyander.
The first citizen of the underwater republic.
Change your clothes and come back here.
All right, father.
When he was a child, I discovered that he had an incurable lung disease.
To save the boy
I gave him the gills of a young shark.
This risky surgery was a success.
Then I had the idea to create an underwater republic.
Salvatore, I admire your genius of a surgeon
But your idea of an underwater republic is an utopian dream.
Sooner or later there will be poor and rich in your underwater realm.
I've heard that before in your newspaper.
OK. Suppose you implant gills to anyone who wants them.
But humans are humans, and
They will miss the land.
This discussion is over, dear Olson.
Don't be afraid. This is my friend, Olsen.
Tell me please, you...
Do you miss people, the land?
Today you learned more than enough.
And remember, not a word to anyone!
Today you brought me nothing useful!
What is this for?
Stop it!
You are acting like a little boy.
You've been attracting quite a bit of attention.
I don't want people to know about you.
The newspapers are writing ridiculous things about you.
Father, I saved a girl yesterday. She was drowning.
Did she see you?
I don't think so. She was unconscious.
She is very beautiful. Only so sad.
I would like to see her smile.
Put your notes in order...
And go to bed.
Father, I want to sleep in the sea tonight.
You know well you cannot stay in the water for a long time.
This could destroy your lungs.
â€œWe should, we should, we should Get to the ocean floor.
We would, we would, we would drink a lot of wine there.
There underneath, Whether we're drunk or sober,
Matters very little under water!
Hey, Sailor! You have been travelling too long,
I've managed to forget you.
Now my heart belongs to the seafaring devil.
And he's the only one I want to love."
Weigh anchor, slip moorings!
Hey, at the rhumba line, Keep steady on the course!
To that Sea Devil We'll take a barrel of rum.
The Devil must be tempted of course!
Hey, Sailor! You have been travelling too long,
I have managed to forget you.
Now my heart belongs to a seafaring devil.
he's the only one I want... to love.'
Olsen, lchthyander has gone to town.
He doesn't know anyone but you there. Try to find him!
All right. I will.
"A fisherman goes out upon the sea
"Goodbye" he says to his wife
Maybe he'll have to rest and sleep In the sandy seabed
He throws a glance at the land and waves with his sun-kissed hand.
If the fisherman did not come back He found his peace at sea.
It's better to lie beneath, in the blue cool sea
Than suffer on this severe, cruel and damned land.
There will be the sound of water,
And centuries will pass
And dark cities will vanish into the white mists.
His wife will fall and weep: the fisherman could not explain
That she should not cry since he had chosen a better lot
His orphaned children must forgive him
That is their fate too.
If the fisherman did not come back He found his peace at sea.
It's better to lie beneath, in the blue cool sea
Than suffer on this severe, cruel and damned land."
Have some coffee! Have a sip! Please!
Wait! Don't go!
Have you seen a young man,
taller than me, with black curly hair and blue eyes?
What kind of shoes is he wearing?
I can't tell you that.
Let me go!
Help! Help!
Here, everybody, take some fish. There's plenty!
Take it!
What is going on here?
This madman gave away all my fish.
Why is he being so greedy? There's plenty of fish in the ocean.
You'd better pay him.
Do you have any money?
- Money? - Yes, money.
I don't know.
Are you really mad?
I think I've got some. Is that enough?
A crazy millionaire!
Nobody has more delicious water than yours
- Do you want more? - No, thank you.
I'd better be going.
You pawned your watch again?
Yes. They shut us down. Too much trouble everywhere.
My friend's son has run away. I've covered the entire city.
Guttiere,
may I borrow your car?
I will look for that boy.
We sold our car. You've not come to see us for ages!
You used to think I was coming to see you too often.
Please, let's not go there, Olsen.
- Listen, Olsen. - Yes?
I'd like to help your paper.
I have a pearl necklace. You could pawn it!
Thank you.
Only it's locked up in my father's safe.
Let's meet tomorrow at the festival near the Black Rock? All right?
All right.
- Who were you talking to? - Just an old friend.
My fiancÃ©e should be more discreet.
Maybe we should find a thicker rope?
It'll hold. Let him only get trapped inside.
Ok.
What can I do for you?
- Hello! - How do you do?
What a strange town. And people are strange here, true?
Excuse me, but what would you like? Who are you?
You don't know me, but I've seen you once before.
What is it that you want?
Wait!
I came here to tell you I love you.
So it's love at first sight?
Is there any other love?
Another old friend?
Go to your father, dear.
Let go of her arm! She doesn't want to go with you.
Can't you see it yourself?
Get out of here!
Is it his house?
Then I won't go.
Oh yes, you will!
Let's go somewhere else.
Police!
- Father! - Get away!
Run!
It's all your fault! You cause me only trouble!
It's a miracle that you came back alive.
I must go back today.
Again?
Try to understand I have hidden you from people for a purpose!
You're much happier than they are. You're the master of the sea.
I don't want to live among fish anymore.
I will die of loneliness.
Why did you make me non-human?
Don't say that. You are a man!
If I'm a man, then do I have the right to love?
Very well then, go.
But you better go by sea. It will be less dangerous.
Thank you, father! I promise I'll be careful.
Remember, pull at my command And no fuss!
Pull, hurry!
Come on, up!
Faster, faster!
Go, go, faster!
Go! move it!
Shoot! Shoot! Don't shoot!
Damn you all! I told you, I told you! we had to have a stronger rope!
- I'd be better off without you. - Don Pedro!..
Let's settle out bills. How much do you owe me?
Don Pedro, I'm almost your father-in-law.
You've been leading me on with that wedding.
The wedding will be on Saturday. I swear!
Bye bye, daddy! I'm off!
Wait a minute!
I told Don Pedro you'll marry him on Saturday.
Father, this marriage might never happen.
We gave him our word. You know well he saved your life.
I will never forget it, but...
Be reasonable. Let's sell the necklace and prepare the dowry.
The necklace?
I don't have it anymore, father.
Your friend is not here yet?
I'm so glad they didn't catch you.
I used to feel great only under water.
Now I feel happy only when I'm next to you.
You speak as if we've known each other for a long time.
And yet I don't even know your name.
- My name is lchthyander. - And mine is Guttiere.
- Guttiere! Like to dance? - No.
Why not?
What have you done?
My pearl necklace is in that bag!
Pearls?
The necklace is in the water.
That stranger dived in for it.
And Sanchez followed him.
It's no use! Too deep!
Sanchez! Where's the guy who jumped in first?
You'll have to find him yourself.
Here he is! Bravo!
Oh, it seemed to me you were under water for eternity.
Thank you.
Thank you. Are you a sailor?
I cannot say who I am. I'm sorry.
Another mystery.
Guttiere!
Coming!
Let's go!
I'd better not.
- Why not? - He loves you.
Who told you?
I've seen the way he looks at you.
I'll come back tomorrow when you're alone.
- Who were you talking to? - He's a marvelous young man.
- Where did he come from? - Most likely from the sky.
You've never said that about me.
They'll be amazed at the pawnshop.
In a month I'll return it to you.
Thank you, Guttiere.
I have a feeling that we've met before.
It must have been in a dream.
But since we met, I am afraid of the sea.
You should not be afraid of the sea. It is kind.
When there's a storm up here, beneath is all calm and peace.
lchthyander!
Here, look.
- Good heavens! How lovely! - It's for you.
For me?
Take them back, or we'll quarrel.
Why? I want you to keep them.
I can't accept it.
Take them.
No.
Listen to me, lchthyander!
Why did you throw the pearls into the sea?
I would have given you my life,
but you wouldn't even accept these pearls.
That means you don't believe in my love.
That means you don't love me.
I was supposed to get married on Saturday .
But I won't, because I've met you.
Do you understand?
- Follow me! Quick! - There he is!
Show me your hands.
That's better.
Why?
Because he almost killed me.
Where's my daughter's necklace?
That's not him! He did not touch the necklace!
Let's go.
- That's the end of him. - Like a rock.
We'll live at my villa outside the town.
Very good. I will sunbathe there, it is excellent for my age.
Well, it is up to you, only not at my villa.
Oh, by the way
You'll need some money...
Guttiere, how could you let this happen?
It does not matter any more. Father will pay his debts now.
Get a new net.
Set it up over the burrow and don't you move until you catch him.
Good luck!
The new mistress of the Villa Dolores.
I must see her.
You seem to have forgotten about this.
Even so, I've got to see her.
You're here again.
- She's locked herself in. - Break the door.
Be a man! Why are you so soft with her?
I love her.
And you sleep at her door step like a dog!
Spineless!
Guttiere!
It's getting ridiculous.
What's the matter?
- Have you caught the sea devil? - No, no, no.
Then what are you doing here? Who's watching the net?
The net? There isn't any net.
- And the money? - There's no money either.
- You drank it up? - I want to see my daughter.
Are you keeping her locked up?
Pedro, you've offended me. God will be your judge.
But I dreamed of seeing Guttiere rich and happy.
I will not allow you torturing her.
Well, she'd torture anyone she wants.
Get out of here!
Put him out, and never let him in here again!
Let go of me!
Guttiere! Are you awake?
Don't be afraid. It's only me.
Good heavens! I thought you were dead.
Pedro, her door may be closed to you,
but her window is open to other men. -What?
I was heartbroken! I thought you had drowned!
I didn't.
I can breathe under water.
That's why people call me the Sea Devil.
But I'm human.
My father is Dr. Salvatore.
Forgive me for not telling you my secret before.
I'm so happy you're alive!
But why did you marry another man?
I thought you drowned. And' Don Pedro saved me from the shark.
- It was I who saved you. - You did?
If only you said so earlier! What have you done!
It's not too late yet.
I'm not going to give you up to anybody! Come on!
Hey, boy, give me the paper!
Boy! Take this to Olsen at the newspaper. Go on!
Go on, swim!
And bring me some pearls while you are at it.
I'm not going to keep you here for long.
Please understand, I spent a lot of money on the net, traps.
Who's going to reimburse me?
A few pearls, and I'll let you go.
You'll let me go? You mean that?
My word of caballero!
Scoundrels!
In forty minutes he brings back a whole fortune.
Good job! Hop in again.
You gave your word.
I would have strangled you if I didn't need you!
Get back to work, you toad!
Do whatever, but I'm not going back into the water!
Have you tried this?!
Hit him until he comes to his senses.
A submarine! Collision course!
Who the hell is that?
Hey, tie the toad to the anchor and drop it to the bottom.
Scoundrels! Let go of him!
Do we have any weapon?
What's that?
This is an underwater harpoon canon effective at the range of 100 yards.
Yes, pretty useless.
Captain, you keep Dr. Salvatore's son on your schooner.
Let him go immediately!
I keep no one here! Lay off! I count to three!
This is an automatic canon.
The very first shell will blow your trough into pieces.
Throw your guns!
I count to two!
One!
Two!
Get the liferaft ready!
You've got my son.
We have no strangers aboard. The word of coballero.
He is here! They tied him up to the anchor!
Ask them to lift the anchor!
Order your man to weigh anchor, or we'll shoot.
Hey! Up the anchor!
- Is that the girl? - Yes, father.
Father, I won't go without her.
Open that cabin.
You can't take her. She is my wife.
There's nothing we can do at present.
The law is on his side. Let's go.
Here's a souvenir for you!
We can't stay here. We'll have to leave.
- Where? - To the Southern Seas.
We'll have to start all over.
To create an underwater republic is not that easy, my dear friend.
My plans were spoiled by a mere chance.
Nobody is safe against such scoundrels as Zurita! Nobody!
But if it hadn't been Zurita, it would have been someone else...
It'll be tragic if your genius of a surgeon is wasted.
And I think everything will be all right.
Doctor! Police is here!
Run! They can't do anything to me. Run.
Dr. Salvatore, you're under arrest.
And you must be lchthyander?
You're under arrest, too.
- Who have you got? - Salvatore and his son.
Where do you see his son? That's the reporter Olsen.
Why didn't you tell me?
You wouldn't have believed me.
I resemble Dr. Salvatore too much.
Be quiet. Soon it will be your turn.
Thank you, but don't rush on my account.
You won't run now, my pretty!
Dr. Salvatore is in prison!
The Sea Devil is arrested!
Pirates attack on the schooner Medusa!
Pedro Zurita brings charges!
Excuse me, Doctor.
- Do you remember me? - No, I don't.
But I will always remember you. You saved my son's life.
Oh, yes...
How is he getting on?
Carlos, doctor has a visitor.
Doctor, it grieves me so to see you here in such condition.
- But if you permit me... - What do you want?
I can return you your freedom, your laboratory, money, glory...
- You? - Yes, precisely.
I can get you out of here, but you...
You'll create hundreds, thousands lchthyanders.
Think of it, doctor! We'll conquer the ocean.
We'll be the richest people on earth! You and I!
- Get out! - Calm down!
Don't forget that your and your son's lives depend on my single word
You both will rot in prison!
You're a scoundrel!
You shouldn't get so upset, doctor. Think about it.
You don't have another choice.
Don't be afraid of them, doctor. I will help you escape.
You said that I saved your son's life.
I am asking you to save mine.
And you? I can't get both of you out.
I'm an old man. It makes no difference where to die.
As you wish.
Do you have any friends you can rely on?
Yes, I do.
Who is there?
It's me.
Go home, father. Don Pedro is still up.
Open up! I have Olsen's letter.
What happened, father?
"Tomorrow I will help lchthyander escape to Australia.
"Do you want to go with him? Olsen."
So he escapes to Australia, and my wife goes with him!
Police!
I beg of you on my knees... Don Pedro...
Police!
Speak up! Who is calling?
Send someone over to the villa Dolores.
I've just murdered a man.
Guttiere! Open the door, quickly!
Run. You must go to Olsen's.
And what about you, father?
I've got things to do here.
Here's the entrance.
The prison.
We'll come out this way.
You have to park the car here.
Everything's clear.
So, Mr. Olsen, it'll be at 9 sharp.
Let's check our watches.
Doctor, we will pass here, you can say goodbye to him.
Come on out now!
Father!
Father!
Have they kept you in that tank all the time?
Yes.
Scoundrels! They've destroyed your lungs!
Forgive me, son.
I tried to make you the happiest man in the world.
But I made you the most unhappy one.
Forgive me and farewell.
What about you?
Farewell!
It is time.
Got a pass?
All right, drive in.
Hey, leave the gates open. I'll dump this and go back.
What's that car doing here? I didn't issue any pass for it.
Run to that truck. He's been waiting for you.
Don't lose time. Move!
It is fake! Sound the alarm!
Olsen... I'm dying...
Are you wounded? What is it?
I can't breathe. I cannot live without water now.
I think we got away from them.
What's wrong with him?
Tell me! Is he dead?
He's alive. But a terrible thing has happened.
lchthyander won't be able to breathe air any more.
The prison has ruined him. He can only live in the water now.
That's it.
I was forbidden to love you. And yet, I could not help loving you.
They separated us, but I kept finding the way back.
How strange, now that nobody parts us,
I have to say goodbye to you forever.
I will always miss the land.
And you will never be forgotten here.
You will be happy.
I want you to be happy one day.
We must hurry.
I promise to do everything in my power to free your father.
Thank you.
Farewell.
The end
