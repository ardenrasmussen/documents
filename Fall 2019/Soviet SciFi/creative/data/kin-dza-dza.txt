- Hello. - Hello.
What's new?
Pipes burst on Manokhin's site.
"... dances and sings kisses all who live well!"
"Mama, mama, what will we do When the cold winter comes?"
"I have no warm scarf"
"I have no warm winter coat"
How's our exemplary student?
Our exemplary student is out playing.
Vovka, go buy some bread, I forgot.
And some pasta too.
- Comrade, There is a man, says he's an alien.
- We have to do something. - Call an ambulance.
I would, but he's almost barefoot. He'll catch a cold.
- Hello. - Hello.
Excuse me, I smell. It's cold here. I got this in the metal box.
Good for you.
Friend! Tell me the number of your planet in the Tenture
or at least the galaxy number in the Spiral.
I got the contacts mixed up and now I can't get back home.
We don't know the number. We forgot, my dear.
The young man here will go call the information hotline
and you and I will wait in the bakery, all right?
And you put this on for now.
Ah, thank you. Listen, friends...
Don't need bakery. Don't need hotline.
This is my planet.
UZM 247 in the Tenture.
Beta Galaxy in the Spiral.
This is the space transference machine.
So which contact do I press to get back home?
Because time is relative. You understand that, right?
All right, how about this: we press the contacts
and transfer to your place.
But if this machine doesn't work
then you transfer with us wherever we transfer you.
All right?
No, that's not allowed.
- You have to know. - Sure it is.
- And you, what do you see? - Sand.
So that damn thing worked.
And that asshole with the holes, he stayed behind?
All right, stay calm.
We have sun, we have sand, we have gravity.
So where are we? We're on Earth.
- Or... - Or?
No, let's suppose we're on Earth, in some desert. Right?
Karakum, eh? What other deserts do we have?
- Gobi, Sahara. - I said "we".
We also have Kyzylkum.
No. Let's suppose this is Karakum. Huh?
So. The sun is in the west.
Then Ashkhabad is that way. Got it? Let's go.
Come, come!
Comrade, what is your name?
Vladimir Nikolaevitch.
And I am Gedevan.
Pleased.
- You have a bottle in the sack. Wine? - No, vinegar.
Have some fresh greens too, coriander.
Good living.
Do you remember which number he said
the one who's got my sock?
No.
Maybe we're on the planet where he came from?
Listen, violinist
we can guess all we want, still won't know the answer.
We picked a direction and we walk.
Most important is to get to the water, is that clear?
Vladimir Nikolaevitch, I want to put my slippers on.
So put them on!
Then you stop!
What time is it?
Four.
AM?
AM.
Are you late?
Just a shame.
Called from the airport, said I'll be there in an hour, but instead...
You study in the conservatory?
No, it's not mine. It's professor Rogozine's.
He was playing a concert for us
and they forgot to put the violin on his plane.
- Banquet? - No, just dinner.
- You're from Tbilissi? - From Batumi.
Thought I'd return the violin and catch the last train home.
I study in Ivanovo, textile institute.
First I applied to Institute of International Relations
But they told me that...
Quiet!
Koo !
A human.
Koo !
- Koo. - Hello!
Koo !
Capitalist country.
Know any foreign languages?
English, a little French.
Tell them we have no money.
Go on, we have to pay.
Gentelmens, sorry ! We haven't money. Now !
Koo.
Hello!
We're soviet tourists! Strayed from our group.
Give us a lift to the city, and we'll manage from there. Translate.
Do you speak English?
Koo ?
- Parle vouz frounzé ? - Koo ?
Hi.
Do you speak English? Parle vouz frounzé?
Spirechens zie deutches?
Koo ?
Tchatl.
No money.
Money, documents, all left with the guide.
Such luck.
Stepped away for a second, got lost in the dunes.
K'u.
Here. It's warm.
Koo ?
- Pardon ? - Koo.
You want the hat?
Here you go.
No, this is not mine, I can't.
There is nothing there.
Open it.
It's not wine, it's vinegar.
Koo !
- K'u ! - Sour, eh?
Friend! So, deal? Give us a lift?
Violinist, hurry.
I said, to the nearest town, and then we'll manage.
Koo !
The sweater?
Bastards!
Good thing I didn't give the violin.
Ashamed.
Ketse !
Ketse !
Ketse !
- Ketse what? - Ketse.
Ketse.
I think he wants the match.
- You want the match? - Ketse !
Here.
Koo.
- The whole box? - Koo !
You take us out of here, and then koo!
Not a single letter, not a single "made in".
Koo !
- Pardon, I don't understand. - Koo !
Sprechen zie turkish ?
K'u !
Koo.
What do they want?
They want koo.
Tsak.
Thank you.
Tsak.
I think he wants me to put it on.
He'll manage.
Tsak.
Tsak.
I think I should.
Go ahead.
Tsak !
Tsak !
Tsak !
Tsak !
Fine, you win.
Ding, ding !
Koo !
Koo !
- Koo. - Koo.
Koo.
Koo.
Koo.
Koo !
Koo.
Koo.
I'll smoke, if you don't mind.
- Ketse ! Ketse ! - All right, calm down.
Ketse !
Vladimir Nikolaevitch, maybe we're really on a...
Yeah. Typical Martians.
K'u !
Lucia, dear, you had to have that damn pasta...
Well.
So we know Russian.
Why hide that?
We didn't hide.
It's hard to penetrate a language when you think in two languages at once.
And this patsak keeps talking in languages he doesn't know!
What are you looking at, maimuno verichvilo ?
- They know Georgian too! - What did he say?
- Monkey, son of donkey. - So...
We are from Soviet Union, on a cultural exchange.
Our people know where we are, they'll be looking.
If you don't assist us in contacting our embassy
you'll have big trouble!
- Is that clear? - Tsak.
Koo.
We don't understand "embassy"! You put tsak back on!
So "pasta" you understand, "maimuno" you understand,
but you don't know "embassy", poor things?
Enough bullshit! All right?
You were thinking about pasta, and I just said it.
This is not Earth, and not Africa, my dear.
This is planet Pluk.
Number 215 in the Tenture.
Kin-dza-dza Galaxy in the Spiral, got it?
Great.
Put on the bell, my dear.
Put it on.
There... Good boy.
Koo !
Excuse me, where are we ?
He has very sensitive ears. You know your planet's Tenture?
Tenture?
Tell us your galaxy number in the Spiral!
- In the Spiral? - Yes, in the Spiral.
The Earth is, you know, where there are other planets, like
Venus, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter...
What are the others?
Ursa Major.
Vladimir Nikolaevitch, come here.
On your planet, can you get more matches?
I'll can find some.
How many will you give is if we put you there?
- How many do you need? - Two full boxes like this.
- Seven! - Seven.
And give us now what you have. I'll by the gravitsappa with it.
Excuse me, what's a gravitsappa?
Without gravitsappa the pepelats can only fly like this.
But with a gravitsappa - anywhere in the universe, in 5 seconds.
Guys, how do you roll out the pepelats without the gravitsappa? Not good.
We had one. But when we came here it was stolen.
Do you have a space transference machine?
- No. - No.
Give the matches.
Give me some water.
- K'u ! - K'u !
- K'u ! - K'u !
Like this! Do it like this! Like this! Like this!
This is yours, smoke like this now.
- Thanks. - Koo !
Koo !
He says they have a gravitsappa.
Put your matches here.
Here's the deal. When you put us on Earth, you get this and this.
What?
Come on, Violonist. Into outer space.
Stop!
Give it back.
- Give it back! - You'll get it on mother Earth.
Vladimir Nikolaevitch
You said if we give you a lift, you'll give us all of them.
Instead you stole a match from us!
Patsak does not cheat patsak. That's not nice, my dear!
I said to the city.
- And what's this? - A shack.
And what's this?
And this?
What's this, not a city?
Stop jerking.
Show your gravitsappa. If it's quality product, we'll take it.
Patsak!
What idiots will take a contraband ketse here, with witnesses
when the penalty is lifetime etsikh with nails!
What's in your head, brains or k'u?!
We'll buy it ourselves. Let's go.
Stop!
Stop, I say!
Who are you?
I'm asking, who are you?
- Alien foreman. - No, you are patsak!
- And who are you? - I'm a Georgian.
No, you too are patsak!
You're patsak, you're patsak, and so is he!
But I am tchatlan, and they are tchatlan.
So you put tsak on and sit in pepelats, got it?
What?
Look in the visator, my dear. Which dot responds?
The green one.
Now look at him.
Also green.
And you are green.
Now look at Uef. Which dot? Orange.
That's because he is tchatlan.
Understand now?
- What? - Pluk is a tchatlan planet.
That's why we patsaks must wear tsaks.
Yes! And go like this before us tchatlans!
Vladimir Nikolaevitch, this is flagrant racism.
Show one more time please.
Like this!
- Be a darling, a little slower. - Like this!
Vladimir Nikolaevitch, at home you have a wife, and idiot son
an unpaid apartment
and here you are screwing around.
Won't end well, my dear.
Here.
All right, Violonist, we'll play this game.
Good boy. Now give the match to Uef, he'll buy the gravitsappa.
- He said he needs all of them. - I was joking.
You are funny guys.
-Koo ! - Wait.
Koo ! We'll go together.
Don't show them your ketse, and don't think about them.
Show them my ketse, and don't give more than half.
Gravitsappa costs half a match.
Your patsak said the whole match.
He was joking too.
Portland cement.
Patsak, remember: half or less!
Fine.
Excuse me, tchatlans and patsaks, it's a nationality?
No.
- Biological factor? - No.
- People from other planets? - No.
Then how are they different?
Are you color blind? Can't tell green from orange?
Tourist!
Skyscraper.
Come, come.
Koo ?
Koo! Do as I showed.
Greetings, madam. Warm enough in the coat?
They won't let me in, just you alone.
Don't give them the ketse, bring gravitsappa here, I'll look.
Go.
Not allowed.
- We're together. - Not allowed.
Tell him!
That's fine.
Wait here.
Don't go anywhere!
Hello.
How goes it?
Want me to sit?
Fine, out of respect for the ladies...
Well, what's new on Pluk?
Put ketse, get gravitsappa.
Half.
Half.
- Can I look? - Look.
You know, I'm not a specialist in gravitsappas.
Let's go show my tchatlan, he'll check it.
Sure, we'll just install the tsappa.
Throat ache?
Water.
Here's the deal: the rest of this ketse
for two bottles of water. All right?
That works.
Got any food?
Porridge.
What kind?
Plastic.
All right, I'll give you this whole ketse
for 5 bottles of water
and a kilo of porridge.
- What's this? - Ketse.
- Gotta check it again. - Then check.
Koo !
Hey! Wait a second!
Hang on.
Violonist, can you get matches on Earth?
I can.
If you spit farther, I give you half tchatl.
Here.
If I do, you'll give me half a match.
- Understand? - No.
It's a simple game.
I give you half tchatl, you give me three matches. Here!
- Spit, son. - Thanks, I don't want to.
Fine, you give me one match
I give you three tchatls, yellow pants and this much head start.
- Go on. - No.
- Blue pants... - No, I won't under any conditions.
Rear word?
Then why are you messing with me
maimuna vereshvila !
Mister Uef, I represent a civilized planet
and I demand you watch your language!
There.
Where are they?
- Who? - The one with the scar.
I, idiot, gave him all the matches.
K'u !
K'u !
K'u !
All right, guys, enough.
Enough! Enough what?!
Told him a thousand times, we should fly downtown.
But he, stingy like all tchatlans
"two tchatls cheaper"! K'u!
I have one more.
Should be enough for a gravitsappa.
Give it to me.
- What for? - To buy the gravitsappa.
But where?
There, downtown.
And how will you get us to mother Earth
if you don't even know which galaxy it's in?
Idiot, your planet number
we can get for two tchatls at any planetarium downtown!
Give the match.
So you can bury us in the sand?
- So you won't? - No.
Is that your rear word?
As rear as they come.
Then goodbye, my dear.
They'll fly away.
They won't. They'll die for this match.
Either you give us that match right now
or we won't put you on Earth for less than 7 boxes!
Two thousand.
Three.
Two thousand three hundred.
Three.
Twenty five hundred, can't do any more.
You can.
Mister Bi.
I have 50 roubles.
Matches are 2 kopeks a box.
So I can buy 2500.
Violonist is lying, he has more tchatls!
Mister Uef, to you I'm not "violinist", my name is Gedevan Aleksandrovitch!
Is that the motor?
Don't stick your nose where it don't belong, Gedevan Alexandrovitch.
Gedevan, let's tie these chaps up and head North
What for?
What if there is the Mediterranean sea?
Are you insane, Vladimir Nikolaevitch? Why would there be seas on Pluk?
They've been turned into lutz long time ago.
Turned into what?
Fuel, Violinist, fuel!
- Here. That will be 6140 boxes. - How come so many?
You ate the porrige, you drink the water. And the bandura.
Leave out the bandura. Put it down.
Let's take it. At least we'll bring some technology back.
Otherwise who will believe us?
So give them the violin if you like it that much.
The violin is Italian, 18th century.
Costs 1000 rubles, if not more. How will I pay?
Koo ?
Koo.
Violonist, instead of thinking this whole time that
you're the first Georgian austronaut
and that you'll get a Nobel Prize
return the spoon you stole from the starving artists!
I was thinking nothing of the sort.
I was going to send it to the Metals Institute. What if it's something new?
Heavens!
Heavens have never seen such a shameful patsak as you, Violinist.
It grieves me deeply.
- Where are you going? - To the toilet.
Can't go to the toilet with money. Leave the money here.
Gedevan Aleksandrovitch.
- Ketse is very valuable, my dear. - How so?
On Earth, how do you determine who before whom
squats how many times?
We take a guess.
Savages.
Listen, I like you, I'll teach you.
If I have a few ketse
I can wear yellow pants
and before me a patsak must squat not once, but twice.
If I have many ketse
I can wear crimson pants
And then a patsak has to squat twice
and a tchatlan has to do "koo"
and ecilop has no right to beat me at night!
Never!
I have a proposition, my dear.
You give us the match now
and we'll bring you yellow pants. Sounds good?
Thanks, already have some. Maybe Violinist needs some?
Violonist! The aliens are pushing pants here!
Yellow! You want?
There is no more Violinist, my dear.
- What do you mean "no more" ? - I ejected him.
Don't worry, we have another catapult. A new one.
That one was broken anyway.
Excuse me?
I pressed the kappa, he flew away.
We don't need the Violinist, my dear. He only uses up fuel.
Turn around!
Cannot.
We're out of lutz, have to fly to the lutz station.
Turn around! Or I'll burn this ketse to hell!
Gedevan!
Violonist!
Violonist!
- Where could he have gone? - Told you
ecilops picked him up.
- Let's go, my dear. - Death is not enough for you!
Radio the ecilops!
We don't have a radio, we threw it out.
- I'll come check. - Ecilop!
Put on the tsak, quick.
Put on the tsak!
He'll be fine.
Koo !
Koo.
Put it on, he'll tranklukate both you and the match.
Koo .
Koo !
Hello. Listen, friend, we lost a young man here.
- Have you seen him? - Koo?
What?
Koo! Sorry, I forgot. I hear you picked him up.
Koo.
Told you we don't need Violonist, didn't I? Didn't I?
With what will we buy lutz now?
With what?
What a douchebag you are, my dear.
He's worse, he's simply k'u!
How about this.
We find Violinist, fly to the local government...
Go get some sand, my dear.
We tell them who we are, from where.
They give us a gravitsappa.
And we arrange...
a mutually beneficial trade.
You give us yellow pants, and we give you all the ketse you want.
To fly to the government you need a gravitsappa.
The government lives on another planet. My dear.
Uncle Vova! I'm here!
Here!
- Violonist! - What?
- Where is my whatsit... - Tsak?
Yes!
- It's here, I have it. - So give it to me.
- But why, out here? - Give it to me, I said.
There is no one around.
- This one is mine. - Then keep it ready.
Are you asleep?
No.
Don't despair, Violinist.
If there is a gravitsappa on this Pluk, we'll get it.
We've gotten worse.
Hold on.
Hey! Stop!
Koo !
Hey! Give us a lift to downtown!
- Patsak, stop. - What?
Don't come any closer.
- What do you want? - Take us downtown.
Three tchatls.
No money. But we'll work for it!
What can you do?
- Me? I can do anything! - What exactly?
Vladimir Nikolaevitch is a builder, a foreman!
We'll build you a house!
And what can you do?
Me?
He can play the violin!
Then play.
- Play. - I cannot!
Bye, patsaks.
Miss, wait, I can!
Play.
Here?
There!
Wait, I'll do the sound.
Play.
And sing.
A moment!
How does it go...
"Mama, mama, what will we do!"
Awesome.
- What? - I said, awesome.
People like!
- What? - The people like!
No.
- Let me drum. - How?
Foreman!
We don't need Violinist.
He's all right. Let me have some water.
I said after the performance.
We could have just taken it
by force. Then you'd be doing the begging.
Touch me, the ecilop will come and rip your legs off.
- Screw your ecilop! - Relax, Violonist.
Don't anger the lady.
Foreman!
Watch.
Alright, I got it.
Got it.
You got anyone with a gravitsappa and a pepelatz?
What for?
He could give us a lift to Earth, and we'd give you both a crate of ketse each.
I know, you people don't trust words. What am I thinking right now?
That your wife is calling around the morgues.
No, I mean, right now.
- That you'll do as promised. - Then it's true.
Ha! No fool thinks the truth on Pluk.
Absurd!
It's because you say what you don't think
and think what you don't think
you sit in your cages.
And this whole bitter cataclysm that I'm observing here
and Vladimir Nikolaevitch too...
Told you, patsaks must perform in a cage, and you'll do it.
Why be the showoffs?
It's all right, my dear, we'll sing here nearby.
Get it, he saw us. He'll tranklukate!
We're not animals.
What?!
- No, you'll get in! - Let go, let go!
K'u !
Koo !
Get inside, he'll melt us!
All right, Violonist, let's do as they ask.
Get in.
One... two... three.
Dance!
Dance.
You know what! Find yourself another ensemble, old man!
What?
A minute.
Time to split. Boys, give me a push, there's an incline.
Anytime.
Hit it!
See ya!
Assholes.
I will tell everyone!
what that clown Pezhe did to this planet!
Patsaks are pushing tchatlans around!
K'u !
Well?
- All there? - She stole the parfume.
Lady.
Let me.
- What do you have in here, lead? - Let me, uncle Vova.
I don't even know which way to look.
Where is Earth?
Galina Borisovna, me and comrade Mashkov, as patsaks,
could make at most 2 tchatls per performance.
Water, lutz and fines from ecilops, that's at least 1 tchatl a day.
Gravitsappa costs half ketse, that's 2200 tchatls.
Divide by 365, subtract weekends, that makes 6.
So I could not return any sooner than 6 years.
That's all good, Gedevan Aleksandrovitch, but those are just words.
Where is the proof that you returned from outer space
and did not sell the violin, as Professor Rogozin claims
and didn't spend all this time at the disco in Gagras?
Here is a mineral.
Here is a tchatl.
Here is the tsak.
The nut and the sand I gave to the dean's secretary
with a note, for her to send it to UNESCO.
- To where? - UNESCO.
Guedevan Alexandrovitch, you are a grown man.
You study for one semester and disappear for years.
The come back with a... pebble
a shard of pottery
and a fishing line bell.
Yet you pretend to...
And also, if you have musical talent
why weren't you participating in the amateur artistic activities?
You'll excuse me, Violinist, but this is elementary k'u!
End of part one.
