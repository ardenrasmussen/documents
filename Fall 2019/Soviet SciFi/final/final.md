Soviet era films were either approved by the government, or they where
suppressed by the government. The primary distinction between these different
sets of films was their portrayal of soviet society, and communist ideals. Many
of the films that were suppressed by the government were critical of soviet
society, or they could be interpreted as critical of society. The films that
were officially supported by the government, there was no possible way to
interpret them as critical of soviet society, they were inarguably pro
communism. Soviet films of the 1970-1980s possess two distinct cinematographic
style. Films which have been categorized as non-approved films share a simpler
cinematographic style, which is distance from the style government approved
films.

Camera movement represents an important role in modern film, and in the early
days of film, cameras were not able to be moved as freely. In many of the
earliest films, most of the scenes consisted of static wide camera, because it
was not possible for easy camera motion or angling. The cinematography of films
can be split into three different components, the angle, the distance, and the
cameras movement. The combinations of these components distinguish different
types of cinematography. Each of the different components of the framing can be
used to affect ones interpretation of the film. For example, a camera that is
very mobile could infer a more fast paced scene, or a more frantic one.

In non-approved films, such as those by German, specifically *Hard to be a
God*(2013), use large amounts of motion, lots of not straight framing, and
significantly more dynamic and active camera motion, to convey an air of
confusion, and disorientation. Contrastingly films that were approved by the
government such as Viktorov's *Per Aspera Ad Astra*(1981), primary use table
cameras, and smooth directed motion, resulting in a more grounded and clear
film.  Although these films came out at significantly different dates, *Hard to
be a God* exemplifies Aleksei German's cinematographic style which he had already
developed by his earlier films, and in his film *My Friend Ivan Lapshin*(1984),
which is a contemporary of *Per Aspera Ad Astra*, also clearly demonstrates this
cinematographic style.

# PARTS???

*Per Aspera Ad Astra* was clearly a critique of capitalist society, it is clear
that the planet Dessa represents a capitalist society, which needed to be saved
by the superior technology of the communist Earth. This clear support of
communism and critique of capitalism is why this film was approved by the
government, as it at no point raised any questions about communism.

*Hard to be a God* is not unabashedly supportive of communist society. In fact,
there are many connections that can be made to the film directly commenting on
the shortcomings of communism and the soviet union. Throughout the film there
is a connection from the Greys and the Blacks to the Soviet union and the
government leaders. This relatively clear critique on soviet society and
communist ideals would have clearly resulted in this film being disapproved of
by the government.

## Camera stability
HG is very shaky, and appears to be hand held, and lots of movement, while PAAA
was very stable, and for the most part either appeared to be on a tripod, or a
dolly, but for the most part it was stationary or a simple pan. The instability
of HG results in a more chaotic feeling film. This chaotic feeling results in
some estrangement, forcing the viewer to more actively pay attention to what is
happening causing more critical though, this forced attention that the viewer
must allows for a more nuanced critique of soviet society.

## Framing
All camera motion in PAAA is intended to keep the focus in frame at all times.
In HG the camera appears to have a mind of its own, frequently loosing attention
and drifting off of the main focus.

## Use of 4th wall break?
In both films the characters often look directly at the camera, but only in HG
do the characters actively interact with the camera, there are many instances of
characters tapping on or waving at the camera. This makes the viewer feel more
like a part of the action, and that the are another character in the film.
