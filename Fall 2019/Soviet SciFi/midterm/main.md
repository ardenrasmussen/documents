Throughout science fiction, the depiction of science and technology can play a
critical role in the development of the underlying themes, and arguments of the
author. In the novel *Red Star* by Alexander Bogdanov technology is used many
times to support Bogdanov's sociological theories and opinions about socialism.
Specifically, his depictions of technology develop the importance of global
unity for the establishment of a successful communist society. Throughout the
novel, Bagdanov depicts the importance of having society be united globally for
his depiction of communism to be successful. He then utilizes the depiction of
technology throughout the novel to advance this idea, and reinforce the
argument for the global unification of society as a prerequisite for a
successful communist utopia.

One point when the selflessness of the Martians is exemplified, and is used to
demonstrate it necessity for the development of an idealized communist society
is on the space ship during the trip to mars. At the begiing of the trip, NAME
explains to NAME how the crew of the space ship work together. EXCERPT. Here
NAME explains that there is no hierarchy on the space ship, and that everyone
simply trusts the knowledge and experience of the others. If any one person was
selfish and did not trust the knowledge of the others, then this social
structure laking a hierarchy would not function. This social structure can only
function if everyone considers themselves equals to everyone else, and only
defers based uppon experience. This structure of sociaty, which has been
condenced to be represented by the society of the crew of the ship, is directly
what Bagdanov considers an ideal social structure for communism. There are no
leaders, and no slaves, everyone is on equal ground, and work only to serve the
greater good for the community.


* Selflessness/Unity
  * All of this only works if people are selfless
    * The spaceship is run off of trusting others and to have the knowledge in
        their field. This allows there to not need to be a hierarchy.
    * The excess of products that allows people to work when and how much they
        want, is only possible by people being selfless and working for the
        good of society. And working wherever there is a shortage of labor.
    * The Grand Canals were only possible to people were willing to work for
        the greater good of society, and were selfless in the sense that they
        are willing to do work for the greater good of the people.
