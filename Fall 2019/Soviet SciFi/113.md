When considering the identity of the guests, and the humans, particularly in consideration of the continuity of body, one's personality traits, and one's memories. In the case of Hari, and the other guests, the body would not be continuous, as there is a long period of time, when the physical form of Hari was not in existence. With respect to Hari's personality traits, the traits of the guest are again dependent on what Kris remembers of the original Hari.  The guest Hari is also laking of the memories of the original Hari, and can only recall a few things.

Clearly the guest version of Hari, is not the same Hari, but only a representation of what Kris recalled of Hari. However, once the second reincarnation of Hari is created, then I would consider this to be a new individual. The second manifestation has continuous body, personality and memories, thus this new Hari is still different from the original, but could be considered her own individual. This new identity of Hari the guest, causes a significant amount of conflict for Kris, as in all ways that he recalls this guest Hari is the same as the original Hari. However, this is a new individual, and is no longer the same Hari that he considers her to be. This disconnect between the version of Hari that Kris relates to, the version of the guest Hari is one of the driving conflict of Kris. Tsarkovsky is depicting the temporal nature of relationships, and how as an individual changes, their relationships change too.
