Protozanov depicts Martian society as closely mimicking that of Russia. He presents mars similar to that of pre-revolution Russia, and then shows the process of the revolution on mars. Then the Martian revolution fails. The overall history of the Martian society appears very allegorical to Russian society, in the conversion to a socialist society through a revolution.  Protozanov places an emphases on the instability of the system, and many of the issues that can arise in socialist society.
In contrast Bogdanov depicts Martian society as very slowly developing into socialism. In this Martian history, the world was already connected into a singular global society, with a single language. Only then did socialism begin to develop. This representation of socialism can be viewed as an idealized form of society. The entire planet is already unified, and peacefully transitions to socialism. As mentioned in the text, Martian socialism would not work on earth, because earth is too divided for it to work properly. Thus this depiction of socialism can be considered as an idealized form, for what the very pinnacle of success could be represented.
