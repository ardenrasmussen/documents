I consider an essential qualification of science fiction to be set in a world with some technological advancement which is currently out of reach of modern society. The advancement needn't be feasible, or in the near future. I think that having the faint possibility that these scientific improvements could occur allows readers/views to consider if they themselves lived in the setting of the work. I regularly read sci-fi, I usually prefer either very near future, or extremely far-future settings.

I don't think that one can just "use" sci-fi. Using sci-fi elements would categorize that work as sci-fi, and works can have many different categorizations, so "using" sci-fi I would consider this to mean that it is partially sci-fi. I think that serious works can absolutely be sci-fi, it is very possible to use the advanced society of sci-fi to shine a light on the issues of current society.
