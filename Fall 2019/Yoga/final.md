Doing yoga daily for the past semester has really helped me get in a routine and
center my mind more. If ind that by doing yoga every day after classes allows
my mind some time to rest and recenter itself. By doing this I feel much more
rested and feel like I can get much more productivity out of the day. After
trying different times of day, specifically I tried doing my yoga in the morning
and trying it in the evening, I decided that doing it after classes but before
doing more work was the best point for me to do it. In the mo ringings I do not
have much time to spend, and in the evenings, I feel that i am missing out on
much of the energy that I get from doing the yoga, so doing it in the middle of
the day when I have enough time to fully relax, and when there is more time in
the day to take advantage of the energy that I get from the yoga.

After a semester of yoga, I have noticed that I am more flexible and am closer
to being able to touch my toes. In addition to this the improvement of my
balance, both mental and physical have been noticeable. I feel that preforming
yoga regularly has forced me to become more balanced in my life, and organized
so that my work and personal life is more balanced.
