\title{Minor Project Proposal}
\author{Arden Rasmussen \and Sean Richardson \and Will McDermott}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

Our primary goal is to develop a comprehension of the mathematical basis of
physics for a zero angular momentum rotations. We will utilize ``Falling Cats,
Parallel Parking, and Polarized Light'', and ``Falling cat robot lands on its
feet'' for the development of the mathematical background. Then once that has
been developed, our goal is to construct a physical representation of this in
the form of a mechanism that will preform this type of rotation. The paper
``Angular Momentum Conservation and the Cat Twist'' by John Ronald Galli gives
a simple mechanical demonstration of the rotation, so we could mimic this
construction or develop our own simple mechanical demonstration.
Having an understanding of the mathematics, this minor project could be
extended to a more in depth major project such as a simulation or a complex
robot that can preform these rotations.
