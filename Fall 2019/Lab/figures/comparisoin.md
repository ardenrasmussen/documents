In common culture the popular explanation for the zero angular momentum
reorientation of the cat is different from what we have followed here. The
common explanation is that the cat utilizes its legs to change the moment of
inertia of one half of the body at a time. By first pulling the legs in on the
front half of the body, and extending the legs on the back half of the body, it
is possible to then rotate the front half quickly, and to preserve angular
momentum, the back half counter rotates more slowly (due to the larger moment
of inertia). Then once the front twist is completed, the legs switch, and the
back half of the cat is then rotated, causing the front half to counter rotate
slowly.

This method is commonly the explanation due to its ease to understand it.
However, it has been shown by REFERENCE that this method does not provide the
necessary magnitude of rotation to allow the cat to rotate completely.  Because
of this short falling, and the demonstrations provided by REFERENCE, we believe
that the explanation that we have considered is likely to be the primary
mechanism for the cats zero angular moment reorientation.
