\subsection{1}
I was first exposed to computer science nine or ten years ago, from by older
brother, who began programming around them. Ever since then I have developed my
skills, through personal challenges. I have pushed myself through the use of
setting personal goals, or projects that I have a desire to create. My own
hunger for knowledge has pushed me to teach myself new programming languages
when different circumstances arise, then my curiosity pushes me to develop
equivalent solutions in several different methods, to determine the best solution
of a set of problems. For tasks that I was not able to determine on my own, I
sought out assistance from my piers, so that I would be able to comprehend the
best solution in the future.

\subsection{2}
The languages that I know best is C++. I have been using C++ for the past nine
years, where I have taught myself everything that I know. I have significant
skill in optimizing C++ code, for the fastest optimum methods. Some of the
significant projects that I have embarked on are as follows. I have created a
program that used varius methods for the Traveling Salesman problem, and
compaired the theoretical time complexities, aswell as their actual time
complexities. I then have also created a fully functional 2D graphics engine
utilizing the OpenGL libraries. I also have an indepth knowledge of much of the
standard library, and the formatting of the functions and classes. I use my
knowledge of the standard libarary to improve the efficiency of my classes, and
algorithms. I have also begun the development of a basic laguage parser in C++,
to better understand the process which laguages are compiled to machine code.
All of my code follows the Google C++ style guide, to improve readablitiy, and
much of it uses Doxygen for comments and documentation generation.

\subsection{3}
My background for computer science is all of my own creation. Everything that I
have learned was done through trial and error. Unlike learning from classes, I
know why i use everything that I do, because it took many hours before i came to
the eventual solutions that I do, I am not given the correct method to work to.
Everything that I know came from some project that needed some new solutions,
and I had to determin those solutions on my own, without a cruch that I could
use when things got to difficult. Because of this I have great perserverinc,
and will not give up on an issue until every posible solution has been
exahusted.
