\section{Relevant Projects}
\cvitem{Lexici}{I constructed a comparison of 20 different programming
languages. I did this by implementing the same algorithm in each of the
languages, and thus I was able to compare run time with respect to the
source size of the code in order to fairly compare different programming
languages. In addition to the data comparison, I have researched the influence
tree of the different languages, and written up a description of how each
language differs from the rest.}
\cvitem{Ray Tracer}{I programmed a ray tracer implementation in C++, using
OpenCL and multi-threading to accelerate the rendering time. I was able to
implement reflections, refractions, and the importing of models/materials from
several different modeling programs.}
\cvitem{Chat Client}{I programmed a back end and a client side interface for an
online message board system. The back end incorporated user authentication, with
passwords saved in a salted hash, and the front end implemented rich text
rendering, and a system to asynchronously updated messages from the server.}
\cvitem{Mathematical}{I created an interpreted language based on standard
mathematical expressions. The expressions are passed through a lexer and parsed
into an abstract-syntax-tree. Then the tree is lazy evaluated in order to
resolve the final answer to the expression. The language implements arbitrary
precision floating point numbers, and all of the standard mathematical
functions. The implementation of symbolic differentiation and integration in
still in progress.}

\section{Programming Tools}
\cvitem{Documentation}{Skilled at creating documentation for source code.}
\cvitem{Unit Testing}{Experienced at creating unit tests}
\cvitem{Linux}{Experienced with eight years using linux operating systems.}
\cvitem{GPU}{Several years of using OpenGL, OpenCL, and some CUDA experience.}

\section{Skills}
\cvitem{Curious}{I will work hard until I can understand the task at hand to
the best of my ability.}
\cvitem{Initiative}{I take action to find solutions to problems}
\cvitem{Focused}{I am extremely focused on the task at hand until it is
completed.}
\cvitem{Adaptable}{I can quickly adapt to working in new teams}
