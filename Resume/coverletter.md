I am a highly dedicated worker, and have completely self taught myself all of
the programming that I know so far. I have incredible amounts of dedication,
and Will focus on a specific task until it is seen to completion. Since
I have taught myself, I have become extremely good at reading and interpreting
other programmers code, event if it lacks comments. The projects that intrigue
me the most are ones that are lower level, such as frameworks and operating
systems. I find these to be the most interesting to myself, because it requires
extremely stable and efficient code in order to scale well for higher level
programmers to use it.
