# 1 #

The primary learning objective is to learn and understand the mathematics and
physics that are the foundation for finite element method. Then to program an
implementation of the method.

# 2 #

My responsibilities are to read the textbook (The Mathematics Theory of Finite
Element Methods), then be able to understand and communicate the information in
a presentation. Using the information that I have gained to program an
implementation of a finite element method, and be able to demonstrate the
programs use.

# 3 #

I will meed and discuss the project with my faculty sponsor weekly, and
feedback will be provided on those regular meetings. My performance will be
evaluated by my understanding of the mathematics, and the quality of the
program that I develop.

# 4 #

I will demonstrate what I have learned in both a verbal presentation, and in
the final product of the code. The final code will be due near the end of the
independent study.

We have arranged to meet weekly on Thursday morning, then we are also able to
communicate over emails.
