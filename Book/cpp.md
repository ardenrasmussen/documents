# Introduction #

This book will develop our ray tracing program in C++. Because of this some
basic knowledge of object oriented programming in C++ should be known, as well
as the basic syntax of the language.

Our goal is to create a ray tracer, that will implement colors, lights,
reflection, retractions and more. We will be able to use this ray tracer to
generate images and short videos.

We will not go into how to display the images that are generated by the ray
tracer. We will write a way to save the images to a `png` file. If you want to
display the images live, then all that is necessary is a way to set a color
with 256 bit color information, and set a single pixel.

Since some of these scenes can take a while to render, we will implement a
method for multi threading the process in order to speed it up.
