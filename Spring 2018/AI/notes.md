# Turing Test

## Alan Turing 1912-1954

-   Important theory of computation
    -   Mathematical model of computer (Turing machine)
        -   Any "Turing-complete" computer can simulate time and memory), so
              they're all equivalent
    -   Some problems are unsolvable
        -   Halting problem
-   During WWII, developed machine to break German codes
    -   Knighted (OBE), 1946 
-   Convicted of "gross indecency" for homosexuality, 1952
    -   Chose probation and hormone injections over prison
    -   Denied entry into US as a result
-   Died of cyanide poisoning, 1954
    -   Ruled suicide, but there is some debate
-   Pardoned by the Queen in 2014

# What is Artificial Intelligence?

## What are we trying to accomplish?

-   Thinking vs acting
-   Humanly vs rationally

Humanity    Think                               Act
----------  ----------------------------------  ----------------
Humanly     Brain modeling                      pass Turing test
Rationally  not too useful in messy real world  YES!

# Rational Agents

## Agent acts in an environment

-   Receives a sequence of precepts through sensors
-   Affects environment by taking actions through actuators
-   Performance measure indicates how well the agent is doing

## PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors)

## Properties of environments

-   Fully observable vs partially observable vs unobservable
-   Single-agent vs multi-agent
-   Deterministic vs stochastic
-   Static vs dynamic vs semi dynamic
-   Discrete vs continuous
-   Known vs unknown
    -   This is about knowing the "rules" in advance

## Rationality

-   Does not demand _omniscience_ -- agent isn't responsible for information it
      would have no way of knowing
    -   This doesn't excuse failure to explore
-   Rationality is defined poorly in terms of behavior
    -   Learning is neither necessary nor sufficient

## Types of agents

-   Agent function maps precepts sequences to actions
    -   Two-location vacuum world example
    -   Implemented by agent program
-   **Reflex**: Always responds same way to a given percent
    -   Randomization may be helpful
        -   Avoid infinite loop in two-location vacuum world
        -   Rock-Paper-Scissors
-   **State-Based**: Has memory, which can be affected by past precepts
    -   Could range form counting to building a map/model of the world
-   **Goal-Based**: Has internal sense of which states are desirable
    -   Chooses actions to reach these states
    -   Reasons about how actions will affect state
-   **Utility-Based**: Has internal sense of performance measure
    -   Chooses actions to maximize utility
-   **Learning**: Adjusts is program based on result of past actions
    -   Perhaps it receives rewards or punishments
    -   May need to balance exploration and exploitation

# Uniform Search

## Problem-solving agents

-   For problems that are observable, single-agent, deterministic, static,
      discrete, and known.
-   Agent observes state, formulates plan, and then carries out the plan.
    -   No feedback from environment while carrying out plan
-   Problem definition
    -   Initial state
    -   Actions function (maps state to available actions)
    -   Transition model (maps state, action pair to successor state)
        -   The states therefor form a graph
    -   Goal test
    -   Path cost function
-   Solution is a path (series of actions) from initial state to goal state.

## Searching for solutions

-   Build a search tree
    -   Notes correspond to states
    -   Expanding a node means creating its children
    -   All leaf nodes form the frontier
    -   General tree search algorithm
        -   Variability comes in which node to expand next
    -   Problem: cycles and redundant paths
        -   Cycles can lead to an infinite loop
        -   Redundant paths can lead to a lot of extra work
        -   Solution: maintain an explored set
        -   The frontier separates the explored and unexplored regions

## Uninformed search strategies

-   Breadth-first search
    -   Expand oldest node first
-   Uniform cost search
    -   Similar, but expands node with lowest path cost
-   Depth-first search
    -   Expand newest node first
-   Depth-limited search
    -   Just like DPF, but you limit the depth
-   Iterative deepening depth-first search
    -   Repeatedly do depth-limited search, but with a larger depth each time
    -   This is the preferred uninformed search method

# Heuristic Search

## Best-first search

-   Choose node to expand based on some function $f(n)$
-   Uniform-cost search uses $f(n)=g(n)$
-   Greedy best-first search: use $f(n)=h(n)$, estimated remaining cost
    -   Greedy because it does what seems best right now
    -   Tree search is incomplete
    -   Graph search is complete for finite spaces
    -   Worst case time and space is $O(b^m)$, where $m$ is maximum depth of search
          space.
-   A\* search uses $f(n)=g(n) + h(n)$
    -   This is the estimated cost of the cheapest path through $n$
    -   Is it optimal? Depends on the heuristic
        -   An admissible heuristic never overestimates the cost
            -   It is optimistic
        -   Consistent heuristic satisfies $h(n) >= c(n, a, n')+h(n')$, $n'$
              being a
              successor of $n$
            -   This is a version of the triangle inequality
            -   All consistent heuristics are admissible
            -   "One has to work quite are to concoct heuristics that are
                  admissible but not consistent"
            -   Straight-line distance is both admissible and consistent
        -   A\* tree search is optimal if $h(n)$ is admissible
        -   A\* graph search is optimal if $h(n)$ is consistent
            -   If $h(n)$ is consistent, then the values of $f(n)$ along any
                  path are non decreasing
            -   Whenever A\* selects a node n for expansion, the optimal path
                  to that node has been found.
            -   Nodes are expanded in increasing order of f(n)
    -   Alternate interpretation: contours
        -   Search works out from start node and never expands anything in a
              contour beyond the optional goal
        -   "With more accurate heuristics, the bands will search toward the goal
              state and become more narrowly focused around the optimal path"
        -   A\* is optimally efficient -- no algorithm expands fewer nodes
    -   Time complexity depends on the quality of the heuristic
    -   Space is still an issue for large problems

## Designing heuristics

-   Relaxing problems
    -   Straight-line distance removes the constraint that you have to travel along
          roads
-   What if we have several heuristics, none of which dominates any of the
      others?
    -   Take the maximum, which dominates all of its components

# Minimax Search

## Variations

-   Opening book
-   Endgame book
-   Depth-limited search
-   Transposition table
-   Alpha-beta pruning
-   Heuristic move suggestion

# Monte Carlo Tree Search

## k-armed bandit problem ##

- Definition: Each pull either pays or doesn't
- Question: how to allocate pulls to maximize return?
- Exploration vs exploitation
- Solution: upper confidence bounds
- One version of formula $$\frac{wins}{pulls} + \frac{explore}{pulls}$$ Where
    $explore$ is a constant
    - To avoid division by zero, we initialize each arm with an imaginary 1 win
        and 2 pulls
    - When there aren't many pulls, the second term can keep under explored arms
        in the running
    - As pulls -> infinity, the second term vanishes

## Monte Carlo techniques in general ##

- Use in a wide variety of problems
- Idea: take many random samples

## Monte Carlo tree search ##

- No need for static evaluation function
- Actually builds a search tree
  - Note that minimax search does not
- For each turn in real game:
  - Create the root node
  - Thousands of times:
    - Play a simulated game from the current game state
    - Update search tree
  - Choose best move from root
- A variation on best-first search, so some branches will be explored more
    deeply than others.
- Treats each node as a k-armed bandit problem
- Each node knows, for each of its children:
  - Number of "pulls"
  - Number of wins in simulated games
- How to play each simulated game?
  - Start at the root and use the upper confidence bound formula to choose a
      child
  - If you fall off the bottom of the tree, add a new leaf
  - Play random moves until the end of the game
  - Update winds and pulls for each node visited in this simulation
- Consequences:
  - Approximation becomes better as a number of simulations increases
  - If a move initially appears good but there is a strong refutation, its win
      rate will increase and then drop off as simulations are focused on the
      proper refutation
  - Good enough time, would thoroughly explore the tree and spend all of its
      time on the best path
