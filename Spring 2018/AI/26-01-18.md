Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach

|          | Humanly                | Rationaly         |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Thinking | Cognitive Science      | (Not very useful) |
| Acting   | Turing Test (too hard) | YES               |

> Acts so as to achieve the best outcome, or, where there is uncertainty, the
> best experteal outcome

An Agent receves percepts through its sensors, and can cause an action through
its actuators.

-   P.erformance
-   E.nvironment
-   A.cturators
-   S.ensors

### Observable ###

-   Fully Observable: Can view all of the enviornment
-   Partially Observable: Can view some of the enviorment
-   Unobservable: Cannot view any of the enviorment

Single Agent/Multi Agent

### Multi Agent ###

-   Competitive
-   Cooperative
-   Semi cooperative

### Determinizm ###


-   Deterministic: Every action is causes perdictable results
-   Stochastic: Actions cause unpredictable results

### Dynamics ###


-   Static: Nothing happens untill an action occurs
-   Dynamic: Enviornment changes while waiting for action
-   Semidynamic: Preformance ranking is effected by time spent thinking

Discrete/Continuous

Known/Unknown

### Types of agents

-   Reflex
-   State-based
-   Goal-based
-   Utility-based
-   Learning


-   Exploration vs Exploitation
