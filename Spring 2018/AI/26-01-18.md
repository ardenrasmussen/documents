>> Acts so as to achieve the best outcome, or, where there is uncertainty, the
>> best experteal outcome

An Agent receves percepts through its sensors, and can cause an action through
its actuators.

P.erformance
E.nvironment
A.cturators
S.ensors

Fully Observable: Can view all of the enviornment
Partially Observable: Can view some of the enviorment
Unobservable: Cannot view any of the enviorment

Single Agent
Multi Agent
* Competitive
* Cooperative
* Semi cooperative

Deterministic: Every action is causes perdictable results
Stochastic: Actions cause unpredictable results

Static: Nothing happens untill an action occurs
Dynamic: Enviornment changes while waiting for action
Semidynamic: Preformance ranking is effected by time spent thinking

Discrete
Continuous

Known
Unknown

### Types of agents ###

Reflex
State-based
Goal-based
Utility-based
Learning
* Exploration vs Exploitation
