There was initially the debate as to weather Homers works were his own or a
collection, but that has shifted to if he was the origin or just transcribed
oral tales. Hurwit thinks that there must have been different authors for the
\textit{Iliad} and the \textit{Odyssey}, because of the stark contrast between
the writing styles, and the characteristics of the heroes.
