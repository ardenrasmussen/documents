\maketitle

Most sculpture that we have from ancient Greece lacks any sign of colors or
pigments. Because of this fact, the casual observer may not even consider that
this was not the intended state. However, through scientific research and
analysis of the sculptures, and through cross referencing with literary
material, we know that this is not the case. Through research we know that
practically all sculpture and architecture was brightly colored. We examine
some of the scientific methods that are utilized in order to ascertain more
insight into the original coloring of a sculpture. This is becomes very useful
when most of the pigments would have faded away due to exposure to light.

The first evidence that we have that ancient sculpture had coloring of any
form, was from the sculptures that were covered in ash in Pompeii. The ash was
able to protect the pigments from the harmful effects of sunlight. Because of
this the pigments of these sculptures were preserved significantly better than
any those used on previously discovered sculptures. This makes it clear that
the sunlight is a significantly harmful factor when it comes to pigment
preservation.

Many of the early attempts at the prediction of the colorization of the
sculpture and architecture, was done before many of the scientific techniques
that are now used today were known. This means that most of those
reconstructions were primarily based on the antithetical preferences of the
historian attempting the reconstruction. These reconstructions only accounted
for a few bits of evidence that was available at the time. The primary evidence
was if color was clearly visible on the sculpture, if it was not, then it was
up to the historian to decide what color should be placed there.

As more methods scientific methods of determining the colorization or the
pigment of sculptures were developed, the accuracy of the reconstructions began
to converge to the ground truth of how it may have been originally painted. We
will go though all of the methods that are used commonly now in order to assist
in the determination of the color if not the pigments for ancient sculpture.

\textbf{Visual Analysis} This is a very simplistic method of analysis for the
determination of pigments present on a sculpture. It simply involves visually
looking at different portions of the sculpture. This can either be done by eye,
or by using tools for optical enhancement, such as a microscope. My looking at
what remains of sculpture, then dependent on how well the sculpture was
preserved, it can be possible to visually identify colors.

\begin{figure}[htpb]

  \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{visual_analysis.png}
  \caption{Peplos Kore, displaying the ability to use visual analysis on
  ancient Greek sculpture.}
  \label{fig:visual_analysis}
\end{figure}

We will describe this process of visual analysis, using the example of the
Peplos Kore from the Acropolis(539BCE) shown in figure \ref{fig:visual_analysis}.
By simply looking at this image of the sculpture, it can clearly be seen that
the hair coloring is not the same as the coloring of the underlying medium. It
is also evident that the hair has a reddish hue. This would fairly directly
indicate that the hair was originally colored red, and though exposure to
radiation, it has faded to where it is now.

\textbf{Raking Light} This is a method that involves shining light from a very
sharp angle, almost parallel to the surface of the sculpture. This method
is used to pick up on the radiation resistance of different pigments, and
colors. Anything exposed to solar radiation will get damaged over time,
some materials will get damaged faster than others. Having a paint over the
marble, acts like a shield, protecting from the solar radiation. So instead
of the marble getting damaged, the paint gets damaged instead. This means
that there will be a raised portion, where the paint was weathered away
instead of the marble. This is depicted in figure \ref{fig:raking_light_1}.

        \draw[dashed] (0,0.2) -- (0.1,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (0.5,0.2) -- (0.6,1.5);

        \draw[dashed] (2.5,0.2) -- (2.6,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (3,0.2) -- (3.1,1.5);
        \node (a) at (1.5, -0.5) {(a)};
      \end{scope}

      \begin{scope}[shift={(4,0)}]
        \draw (0,-0.2) -- (0.9,-0.2) -- (1,0) -- (2,0) -- (2.1,-0.2) -- (3,-0.2);
        \draw[dashed] (0,0) -- (0.1,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (0.5,0) -- (0.6,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (1,0.2) -- (1.1,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (1.5,0.2) -- (1.6,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (2,0.2) -- (2.1,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (2.5,0) -- (2.6,1.5);
        \draw[dashed] (3,0) -- (3.1,1.5);
        \node (b) at (1.5, -0.5) {(b)};
      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Demonstrating the process of solar radiation wearing through the
    marble surface, where the center segment is protected by some pigment. Over
  time smooth surfaces of (a) will develop bumps like the surface of (b).}
  \label{fig:raking_light_1}
\end{figure}

This method becomes very useful to determine where different pigments were on a
sculpture, and to ascertain the location of the transitions between them. Since
each pigment would protect the underlying medium different amounts, each
pigment would leave a different sized "bump" on the sculpture. There is little
to gain about the actual color using this method, but it does allow for knowing
where the different colors start and end.

By shining a light almost perpendicular to the surface of the sculpture it is
possible to see these microscopic ridges on the surface of the sculpture. This
process is clearly depicted in figure \ref{fig:raking_light_2}. It can be seen
that the parts of the sculpture that face the light source will be emphasized,
and the parts of the sculpture that face away from the source will be obscured
in shadow. This allows the distinction between different surfaces, that may be
impossible to visually see without the enhancement resultant from the shadows and
highlights.

      \draw[dashed] (0.0,0.2) -- (3.0,0.8);
      \draw[dashed] (0.0,0.1) -- (3.0,0.7);
      \draw[dashed] (0.0,0) -- (3.0,0.6);
      \draw[dashed] (1.5,0.2) -- (3.0,0.5);
      \draw[dashed] (1.769,0.153) -- (3.0,0.4);

      \draw[dashed] (2.0,0) -- (3.0,0.2);
      \draw[dashed] (2.5,0) -- (3.0,0.1);
    \end{tikzpicture}

    ridges on the surface of a material. This allows for the determination of where
  pigments would have been present.}
  \label{fig:raking_light_2}
\end{figure}

This method of raking light does not provide researchers will too much
information about what pigments were actually present on a sculpture, but it
does help in the determination of the regions of different pigments. Thus if a
pigment is determined anywhere in the region, it is reasonable to  believe
that that pigment was used for the entirety of the region.

\textbf{UV Florescence} This method begins utilizing the chemical composition
of the pigments themselves in order to assist in determining the colors.
Certain pigments will absorb light in the ultraviolet frequencies, and will
remit the light at a lower frequency in the visual spectrum. This method is
done just by shining ultraviolet light on the sculpture, then watching for any
parts of the sculpture that glow when the light is removed, and what color the
pigments glow also assist in determining what the pigment could be. Using the
observations of this method do not necessarily provide a direct answer to what
pigment or colors were used, it certainly assists in narrowing down the
options of what pigments might have been used.

This method is also closely related to the more scientific method of UV vis.
They both use the properties of how the pigments interact with ultraviolet
light. Since different pigments will interact with ultraviolet light in
different ways, and will also interact differently for different frequencies of
the ultraviolet light.
