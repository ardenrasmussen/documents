Absorbance, Shinsh a tungstan bulb though the solution. Sensore difracts the
wavelengths and uses sensors to detect the different wavelenegs that remain,
and how much they remain.

Reflectance. Light and prbobe shne light directly and at 45 degree angle. 45 is
better to avoid gitting the insedanc light. Then the same detaction process is
used to determine which wavelengths that were reflected.

In visible tells us the color the the pigment. In uv spectrum the absorbance is
determined by the chemical structure. In IR, it determins the rotations and
vibrations of the chemcial.

Wavelengths of color absorbed the opposit is observed.
