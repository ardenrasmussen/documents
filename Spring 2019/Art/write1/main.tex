I'm interested in the integration of Greek myths into their art, and how they
used the generalized myths to give insight into specific situations. I'm also
thinking about more along the lines of how the restoration is done, and how on
site researchers are able to determine what they believe to be the actual
configuration or interpretation of the art.
