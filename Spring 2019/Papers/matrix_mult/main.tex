\begin{abstract}
   Matrix multiplication is used in all areas of computer science, and
   mathematics. Thus because of its wide spread use, an efficient algorithm for
   matrix multiplication is very important. The purpose of this paper is to
   describe a number of key algorithms that are used for efficient matrix
   multiplication, and when to use the different algorithms. It will also
   provide a short history of matrix multiplication algorithms, and the current
   state of these algorithms.

\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

Matrix multiplication is the process of multiplying two matrices together. This
process is very simplistic, it is only once there are many many
multiplications, or very large matrices, that this process begins to slow
down, and must be improved.

\subsection{Notation}%
\label{sub:notation}

We will denote the notation of a matrix as $A$, and the elements of that matrix
are denoted as $a_{i,j}$.

\section{Mathematics}%
\label{sec:mathematics}

Naive matrix multiplication can be computed using the following mathematics.
